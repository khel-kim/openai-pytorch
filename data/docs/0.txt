PART I
CHAPTER I
On an exceptionally hot evening early in July a young man came out ofthe garret in which he lodged in S. Place and walked slowly, as thoughin hesitation, towards K. bridge.
He had successfully avoided meeting his landlady on the staircase. Hisgarret was under the roof of a high, five-storied house and was morelike a cupboard than a room. The landlady who provided him with garret,dinners, and attendance, lived on the floor below, and every timehe went out he was obliged to pass her kitchen, the door of whichinvariably stood open. And each time he passed, the young man had asick, frightened feeling, which made him scowl and feel ashamed. He washopelessly in debt to his landlady, and was afraid of meeting her.
This was not because he was cowardly and abject, quite the contrary; butfor some time past he had been in an overstrained irritable condition,verging on hypochondria. He had become so completely absorbed inhimself, and isolated from his fellows that he dreaded meeting, notonly his landlady, but anyone at all. He was crushed by poverty, but theanxieties of his position had of late ceased to weigh upon him. He hadgiven up attending to matters of practical importance; he had lost alldesire to do so. Nothing that any landlady could do had a real terrorfor him. But to be stopped on the stairs, to be forced to listen to hertrivial, irrelevant gossip, to pestering demands for payment, threatsand complaints, and to rack his brains for excuses, to prevaricate, tolie--no, rather than that, he would creep down the stairs like a cat andslip out unseen.
This evening, however, on coming out into the street, he became acutelyaware of his fears.
“I want to attempt a thing _like that_ and am frightened by thesetrifles,” he thought, with an odd smile. “Hm... yes, all is in a man’shands and he lets it all slip from cowardice, that’s an axiom. It wouldbe interesting to know what it is men are most afraid of. Taking a newstep, uttering a new word is what they fear most.... But I am talkingtoo much. It’s because I chatter that I do nothing. Or perhaps it isthat I chatter because I do nothing. I’ve learned to chatter thislast month, lying for days together in my den thinking... of Jack theGiant-killer. Why am I going there now? Am I capable of _that_? Is_that_ serious? It is not serious at all. It’s simply a fantasy to amusemyself; a plaything! Yes, maybe it is a plaything.”
The heat in the street was terrible: and the airlessness, the bustleand the plaster, scaffolding, bricks, and dust all about him, and thatspecial Petersburg stench, so familiar to all who are unable to get outof town in summer--all worked painfully upon the young man’s alreadyoverwrought nerves. The insufferable stench from the pot-houses, whichare particularly numerous in that part of the town, and the drunken menwhom he met continually, although it was a working day, completedthe revolting misery of the picture. An expression of the profoundestdisgust gleamed for a moment in the young man’s refined face. He was,by the way, exceptionally handsome, above the average in height, slim,well-built, with beautiful dark eyes and dark brown hair. Soon he sankinto deep thought, or more accurately speaking into a complete blanknessof mind; he walked along not observing what was about him and not caringto observe it. From time to time, he would mutter something, from thehabit of talking to himself, to which he had just confessed. At thesemoments he would become conscious that his ideas were sometimes in atangle and that he was very weak; for two days he had scarcely tastedfood.
He was so badly dressed that even a man accustomed to shabbiness wouldhave been ashamed to be seen in the street in such rags. In that quarterof the town, however, scarcely any shortcoming in dress would havecreated surprise. Owing to the proximity of the Hay Market, the numberof establishments of bad character, the preponderance of the tradingand working class population crowded in these streets and alleys in theheart of Petersburg, types so various were to be seen in the streetsthat no figure, however queer, would have caused surprise. But there wassuch accumulated bitterness and contempt in the young man’s heart, that,in spite of all the fastidiousness of youth, he minded his rags leastof all in the street. It was a different matter when he met withacquaintances or with former fellow students, whom, indeed, he dislikedmeeting at any time. And yet when a drunken man who, for some unknownreason, was being taken somewhere in a huge waggon dragged by a heavydray horse, suddenly shouted at him as he drove past: “Hey there, Germanhatter” bawling at the top of his voice and pointing at him--the youngman stopped suddenly and clutched tremulously at his hat. It was a tallround hat from Zimmerman’s, but completely worn out, rusty with age, alltorn and bespattered, brimless and bent on one side in a most unseemlyfashion. Not shame, however, but quite another feeling akin to terrorhad overtaken him.
“I knew it,” he muttered in confusion, “I thought so! That’s the worstof all! Why, a stupid thing like this, the most trivial detail mightspoil the whole plan. Yes, my hat is too noticeable.... It looks absurdand that makes it noticeable.... With my rags I ought to wear a cap, anysort of old pancake, but not this grotesque thing. Nobody wears sucha hat, it would be noticed a mile off, it would be remembered.... Whatmatters is that people would remember it, and that would give thema clue. For this business one should be as little conspicuous aspossible.... Trifles, trifles are what matter! Why, it’s just suchtrifles that always ruin everything....”
He had not far to go; he knew indeed how many steps it was from the gateof his lodging house: exactly seven hundred and thirty. He had countedthem once when he had been lost in dreams. At the time he had put nofaith in those dreams and was only tantalising himself by their hideousbut daring recklessness. Now, a month later, he had begun to look uponthem differently, and, in spite of the monologues in which he jeered athis own impotence and indecision, he had involuntarily come to regardthis “hideous” dream as an exploit to be attempted, although hestill did not realise this himself. He was positively going now for a“rehearsal” of his project, and at every step his excitement grew moreand more violent.
With a sinking heart and a nervous tremor, he went up to a huge housewhich on one side looked on to the canal, and on the other into thestreet. This house was let out in tiny tenements and was inhabited byworking people of all kinds--tailors, locksmiths, cooks, Germans ofsorts, girls picking up a living as best they could, petty clerks, etc.There was a continual coming and going through the two gates and in thetwo courtyards of the house. Three or four door-keepers were employed onthe building. The young man was very glad to meet none of them, andat once slipped unnoticed through the door on the right, and up thestaircase. It was a back staircase, dark and narrow, but he was familiarwith it already, and knew his way, and he liked all these surroundings:in such darkness even the most inquisitive eyes were not to be dreaded.
“If I am so scared now, what would it be if it somehow came to pass thatI were really going to do it?” he could not help asking himself as hereached the fourth storey. There his progress was barred by some porterswho were engaged in moving furniture out of a flat. He knew that theflat had been occupied by a German clerk in the civil service, and hisfamily. This German was moving out then, and so the fourth floor on thisstaircase would be untenanted except by the old woman. “That’s a goodthing anyway,” he thought to himself, as he rang the bell of the oldwoman’s flat. The bell gave a faint tinkle as though it were made oftin and not of copper. The little flats in such houses always have bellsthat ring like that. He had forgotten the note of that bell, and nowits peculiar tinkle seemed to remind him of something and to bring itclearly before him.... He started, his nerves were terribly overstrainedby now. In a little while, the door was opened a tiny crack: the oldwoman eyed her visitor with evident distrust through the crack, andnothing could be seen but her little eyes, glittering in the darkness.But, seeing a number of people on the landing, she grew bolder, andopened the door wide. The young man stepped into the dark entry, whichwas partitioned off from the tiny kitchen. The old woman stood facinghim in silence and looking inquiringly at him. She was a diminutive,withered up old woman of sixty, with sharp malignant eyes and a sharplittle nose. Her colourless, somewhat grizzled hair was thickly smearedwith oil, and she wore no kerchief over it. Round her thin long neck,which looked like a hen’s leg, was knotted some sort of flannel rag,and, in spite of the heat, there hung flapping on her shoulders, a mangyfur cape, yellow with age. The old woman coughed and groaned at everyinstant. The young man must have looked at her with a rather peculiarexpression, for a gleam of mistrust came into her eyes again.
“Raskolnikov, a student, I came here a month ago,” the young man madehaste to mutter, with a half bow, remembering that he ought to be morepolite.
“I remember, my good sir, I remember quite well your coming here,” theold woman said distinctly, still keeping her inquiring eyes on his face.
“And here... I am again on the same errand,” Raskolnikov continued, alittle disconcerted and surprised at the old woman’s mistrust. “Perhapsshe is always like that though, only I did not notice it the othertime,” he thought with an uneasy feeling.
The old woman paused, as though hesitating; then stepped on one side,and pointing to the door of the room, she said, letting her visitor passin front of her:
“Step in, my good sir.”
The little room into which the young man walked, with yellow paper onthe walls, geraniums and muslin curtains in the windows, was brightlylighted up at that moment by the setting sun.
“So the sun will shine like this _then_ too!” flashed as it were bychance through Raskolnikov’s mind, and with a rapid glance he scannedeverything in the room, trying as far as possible to notice andremember its arrangement. But there was nothing special in the room. Thefurniture, all very old and of yellow wood, consisted of a sofa witha huge bent wooden back, an oval table in front of the sofa, adressing-table with a looking-glass fixed on it between the windows,chairs along the walls and two or three half-penny prints in yellowframes, representing German damsels with birds in their hands--that wasall. In the corner a light was burning before a small ikon. Everythingwas very clean; the floor and the furniture were brightly polished;everything shone.
“Lizaveta’s work,” thought the young man. There was not a speck of dustto be seen in the whole flat.
“It’s in the houses of spiteful old widows that one finds suchcleanliness,” Raskolnikov thought again, and he stole a curious glanceat the cotton curtain over the door leading into another tiny room, inwhich stood the old woman’s bed and chest of drawers and into which hehad never looked before. These two rooms made up the whole flat.
“What do you want?” the old woman said severely, coming into the roomand, as before, standing in front of him so as to look him straight inthe face.
“I’ve brought something to pawn here,” and he drew out of his pocketan old-fashioned flat silver watch, on the back of which was engraved aglobe; the chain was of steel.
“But the time is up for your last pledge. The month was up the daybefore yesterday.”
“I will bring you the interest for another month; wait a little.”
“But that’s for me to do as I please, my good sir, to wait or to sellyour pledge at once.”
“How much will you give me for the watch, Alyona Ivanovna?”
“You come with such trifles, my good sir, it’s scarcely worth anything.I gave you two roubles last time for your ring and one could buy itquite new at a jeweler’s for a rouble and a half.”
“Give me four roubles for it, I shall redeem it, it was my father’s. Ishall be getting some money soon.”
“A rouble and a half, and interest in advance, if you like!”
“A rouble and a half!” cried the young man.
“Please yourself”--and the old woman handed him back the watch. Theyoung man took it, and was so angry that he was on the point of goingaway; but checked himself at once, remembering that there was nowhereelse he could go, and that he had had another object also in coming.
“Hand it over,” he said roughly.
The old woman fumbled in her pocket for her keys, and disappeared behindthe curtain into the other room. The young man, left standing alone inthe middle of the room, listened inquisitively, thinking. He could hearher unlocking the chest of drawers.
“It must be the top drawer,” he reflected. “So she carries the keys ina pocket on the right. All in one bunch on a steel ring.... And there’sone key there, three times as big as all the others, with deep notches;that can’t be the key of the chest of drawers... then there must be someother chest or strong-box... that’s worth knowing. Strong-boxes alwayshave keys like that... but how degrading it all is.”
The old woman came back.
“Here, sir: as we say ten copecks the rouble a month, so I must takefifteen copecks from a rouble and a half for the month in advance. Butfor the two roubles I lent you before, you owe me now twenty copeckson the same reckoning in advance. That makes thirty-five copecksaltogether. So I must give you a rouble and fifteen copecks for thewatch. Here it is.”
“What! only a rouble and fifteen copecks now!”
“Just so.”
The young man did not dispute it and took the money. He looked at theold woman, and was in no hurry to get away, as though there was stillsomething he wanted to say or to do, but he did not himself quite knowwhat.
“I may be bringing you something else in a day or two, AlyonaIvanovna--a valuable thing--silver--a cigarette-box, as soon as I get itback from a friend...” he broke off in confusion.
“Well, we will talk about it then, sir.”
“Good-bye--are you always at home alone, your sister is not here withyou?” He asked her as casually as possible as he went out into thepassage.
“What business is she of yours, my good sir?”
“Oh, nothing particular, I simply asked. You are too quick.... Good-day,Alyona Ivanovna.”
Raskolnikov went out in complete confusion. This confusion became moreand more intense. As he went down the stairs, he even stopped short, twoor three times, as though suddenly struck by some thought. When he wasin the street he cried out, “Oh, God, how loathsome it all is! andcan I, can I possibly.... No, it’s nonsense, it’s rubbish!” he addedresolutely. “And how could such an atrocious thing come into my head?What filthy things my heart is capable of. Yes, filthy above all,disgusting, loathsome, loathsome!--and for a whole month I’ve been....”But no words, no exclamations, could express his agitation. The feelingof intense repulsion, which had begun to oppress and torture his heartwhile he was on his way to the old woman, had by now reached such apitch and had taken such a definite form that he did not know what todo with himself to escape from his wretchedness. He walked along thepavement like a drunken man, regardless of the passers-by, and jostlingagainst them, and only came to his senses when he was in the nextstreet. Looking round, he noticed that he was standing close to a tavernwhich was entered by steps leading from the pavement to the basement.At that instant two drunken men came out at the door, and abusing andsupporting one another, they mounted the steps. Without stopping tothink, Raskolnikov went down the steps at once. Till that moment he hadnever been into a tavern, but now he felt giddy and was tormented by aburning thirst. He longed for a drink of cold beer, and attributed hissudden weakness to the want of food. He sat down at a sticky littletable in a dark and dirty corner; ordered some beer, and eagerly drankoff the first glassful. At once he felt easier; and his thoughts becameclear.
“All that’s nonsense,” he said hopefully, “and there is nothing in itall to worry about! It’s simply physical derangement. Just a glass ofbeer, a piece of dry bread--and in one moment the brain is stronger,the mind is clearer and the will is firm! Phew, how utterly petty it allis!”
But in spite of this scornful reflection, he was by now looking cheerfulas though he were suddenly set free from a terrible burden: and he gazedround in a friendly way at the people in the room. But even at thatmoment he had a dim foreboding that this happier frame of mind was alsonot normal.
There were few people at the time in the tavern. Besides the two drunkenmen he had met on the steps, a group consisting of about five men anda girl with a concertina had gone out at the same time. Their departureleft the room quiet and rather empty. The persons still in the tavernwere a man who appeared to be an artisan, drunk, but not extremely so,sitting before a pot of beer, and his companion, a huge, stout man witha grey beard, in a short full-skirted coat. He was very drunk: and haddropped asleep on the bench; every now and then, he began as though inhis sleep, cracking his fingers, with his arms wide apart and the upperpart of his body bounding about on the bench, while he hummed somemeaningless refrain, trying to recall some such lines as these:
“His wife a year he fondly lovedHis wife a--a year he--fondly loved.”
Or suddenly waking up again:
“Walking along the crowded rowHe met the one he used to know.”
But no one shared his enjoyment: his silent companion looked withpositive hostility and mistrust at all these manifestations. There wasanother man in the room who looked somewhat like a retired governmentclerk. He was sitting apart, now and then sipping from his pot andlooking round at the company. He, too, appeared to be in some agitation.
CHAPTER II
Raskolnikov was not used to crowds, and, as we said before, he avoidedsociety of every sort, more especially of late. But now all at once hefelt a desire to be with other people. Something new seemed to be takingplace within him, and with it he felt a sort of thirst for company. Hewas so weary after a whole month of concentrated wretchedness and gloomyexcitement that he longed to rest, if only for a moment, in some otherworld, whatever it might be; and, in spite of the filthiness of thesurroundings, he was glad now to stay in the tavern.
The master of the establishment was in another room, but he frequentlycame down some steps into the main room, his jaunty, tarred boots withred turn-over tops coming into view each time before the rest of hisperson. He wore a full coat and a horribly greasy black satin waistcoat,with no cravat, and his whole face seemed smeared with oil like aniron lock. At the counter stood a boy of about fourteen, and there wasanother boy somewhat younger who handed whatever was wanted. On thecounter lay some sliced cucumber, some pieces of dried black bread, andsome fish, chopped up small, all smelling very bad. It was insufferablyclose, and so heavy with the fumes of spirits that five minutes in suchan atmosphere might well make a man drunk.
There are chance meetings with strangers that interest us from thefirst moment, before a word is spoken. Such was the impression made onRaskolnikov by the person sitting a little distance from him, who lookedlike a retired clerk. The young man often recalled this impressionafterwards, and even ascribed it to presentiment. He looked repeatedlyat the clerk, partly no doubt because the latter was staringpersistently at him, obviously anxious to enter into conversation. Atthe other persons in the room, including the tavern-keeper, the clerklooked as though he were used to their company, and weary of it, showinga shade of condescending contempt for them as persons of station andculture inferior to his own, with whom it would be useless for him toconverse. He was a man over fifty, bald and grizzled, of medium height,and stoutly built. His face, bloated from continual drinking, was ofa yellow, even greenish, tinge, with swollen eyelids out of which keenreddish eyes gleamed like little chinks. But there was something verystrange in him; there was a light in his eyes as though of intensefeeling--perhaps there were even thought and intelligence, but at thesame time there was a gleam of something like madness. He was wearing anold and hopelessly ragged black dress coat, with all its buttons missingexcept one, and that one he had buttoned, evidently clinging to thislast trace of respectability. A crumpled shirt front, covered with spotsand stains, protruded from his canvas waistcoat. Like a clerk, he woreno beard, nor moustache, but had been so long unshaven that his chinlooked like a stiff greyish brush. And there was something respectableand like an official about his manner too. But he was restless; heruffled up his hair and from time to time let his head drop into hishands dejectedly resting his ragged elbows on the stained and stickytable. At last he looked straight at Raskolnikov, and said loudly andresolutely:
“May I venture, honoured sir, to engage you in polite conversation?Forasmuch as, though your exterior would not command respect, myexperience admonishes me that you are a man of education and notaccustomed to drinking. I have always respected education when inconjunction with genuine sentiments, and I am besides a titularcounsellor in rank. Marmeladov--such is my name; titular counsellor. Imake bold to inquire--have you been in the service?”
“No, I am studying,” answered the young man, somewhat surprised atthe grandiloquent style of the speaker and also at being so directlyaddressed. In spite of the momentary desire he had just been feeling forcompany of any sort, on being actually spoken to he felt immediately hishabitual irritable and uneasy aversion for any stranger who approachedor attempted to approach him.
“A student then, or formerly a student,” cried the clerk. “Just whatI thought! I’m a man of experience, immense experience, sir,” and hetapped his forehead with his fingers in self-approval. “You’ve been astudent or have attended some learned institution!... But allow me....”He got up, staggered, took up his jug and glass, and sat down besidethe young man, facing him a little sideways. He was drunk, but spokefluently and boldly, only occasionally losing the thread of hissentences and drawling his words. He pounced upon Raskolnikov asgreedily as though he too had not spoken to a soul for a month.
“Honoured sir,” he began almost with solemnity, “poverty is not a vice,that’s a true saying. Yet I know too that drunkenness is not a virtue,and that that’s even truer. But beggary, honoured sir, beggary is avice. In poverty you may still retain your innate nobility of soul, butin beggary--never--no one. For beggary a man is not chased out of humansociety with a stick, he is swept out with a broom, so as to make it ashumiliating as possible; and quite right, too, forasmuch as in beggaryI am ready to be the first to humiliate myself. Hence the pot-house!Honoured sir, a month ago Mr. Lebeziatnikov gave my wife a beating, andmy wife is a very different matter from me! Do you understand? Allow meto ask you another question out of simple curiosity: have you ever spenta night on a hay barge, on the Neva?”
“No, I have not happened to,” answered Raskolnikov. “What do you mean?”
“Well, I’ve just come from one and it’s the fifth night I’ve sleptso....” He filled his glass, emptied it and paused. Bits of hay were infact clinging to his clothes and sticking to his hair. It seemed quiteprobable that he had not undressed or washed for the last five days.His hands, particularly, were filthy. They were fat and red, with blacknails.
His conversation seemed to excite a general though languid interest. Theboys at the counter fell to sniggering. The innkeeper came down from theupper room, apparently on purpose to listen to the “funny fellow”and sat down at a little distance, yawning lazily, but with dignity.Evidently Marmeladov was a familiar figure here, and he had mostlikely acquired his weakness for high-flown speeches from the habit offrequently entering into conversation with strangers of all sorts inthe tavern. This habit develops into a necessity in some drunkards, andespecially in those who are looked after sharply and kept in orderat home. Hence in the company of other drinkers they try to justifythemselves and even if possible obtain consideration.
“Funny fellow!” pronounced the innkeeper. “And why don’t you work, whyaren’t you at your duty, if you are in the service?”
“Why am I not at my duty, honoured sir,” Marmeladov went on, addressinghimself exclusively to Raskolnikov, as though it had been he who putthat question to him. “Why am I not at my duty? Does not my heart acheto think what a useless worm I am? A month ago when Mr. Lebeziatnikovbeat my wife with his own hands, and I lay drunk, didn’t I suffer?Excuse me, young man, has it ever happened to you... hm... well, topetition hopelessly for a loan?”
“Yes, it has. But what do you mean by hopelessly?”
“Hopelessly in the fullest sense, when you know beforehand that youwill get nothing by it. You know, for instance, beforehand with positivecertainty that this man, this most reputable and exemplary citizen, willon no consideration give you money; and indeed I ask you why should he?For he knows of course that I shan’t pay it back. From compassion? ButMr. Lebeziatnikov who keeps up with modern ideas explained the other daythat compassion is forbidden nowadays by science itself, and that that’swhat is done now in England, where there is political economy. Why, Iask you, should he give it to me? And yet though I know beforehand thathe won’t, I set off to him and...”
“Why do you go?” put in Raskolnikov.
“Well, when one has no one, nowhere else one can go! For every man musthave somewhere to go. Since there are times when one absolutely mustgo somewhere! When my own daughter first went out with a yellow ticket,then I had to go... (for my daughter has a yellow passport),” he addedin parenthesis, looking with a certain uneasiness at the young man.“No matter, sir, no matter!” he went on hurriedly and with apparentcomposure when both the boys at the counter guffawed and even theinnkeeper smiled--“No matter, I am not confounded by the wagging oftheir heads; for everyone knows everything about it already, and allthat is secret is made open. And I accept it all, not with contempt, butwith humility. So be it! So be it! ‘Behold the man!’ Excuse me, youngman, can you.... No, to put it more strongly and more distinctly; not_can_ you but _dare_ you, looking upon me, assert that I am not a pig?”
The young man did not answer a word.
“Well,” the orator began again stolidly and with even increased dignity,after waiting for the laughter in the room to subside. “Well, so beit, I am a pig, but she is a lady! I have the semblance of a beast, butKaterina Ivanovna, my spouse, is a person of education and an officer’sdaughter. Granted, granted, I am a scoundrel, but she is a woman of anoble heart, full of sentiments, refined by education. And yet... oh,if only she felt for me! Honoured sir, honoured sir, you know every manought to have at least one place where people feel for him! But KaterinaIvanovna, though she is magnanimous, she is unjust.... And yet, althoughI realise that when she pulls my hair she only does it out of pity--forI repeat without being ashamed, she pulls my hair, young man,” hedeclared with redoubled dignity, hearing the sniggering again--“but, myGod, if she would but once.... But no, no! It’s all in vain and it’s nouse talking! No use talking! For more than once, my wish did come trueand more than once she has felt for me but... such is my fate and I am abeast by nature!”
“Rather!” assented the innkeeper yawning. Marmeladov struck his fistresolutely on the table.
“Such is my fate! Do you know, sir, do you know, I have sold her verystockings for drink? Not her shoes--that would be more or less in theorder of things, but her stockings, her stockings I have sold for drink!Her mohair shawl I sold for drink, a present to her long ago, her ownproperty, not mine; and we live in a cold room and she caught cold thiswinter and has begun coughing and spitting blood too. We have threelittle children and Katerina Ivanovna is at work from morning tillnight; she is scrubbing and cleaning and washing the children, for she’sbeen used to cleanliness from a child. But her chest is weak and she hasa tendency to consumption and I feel it! Do you suppose I don’t feel it?And the more I drink the more I feel it. That’s why I drink too. I tryto find sympathy and feeling in drink.... I drink so that I may suffertwice as much!” And as though in despair he laid his head down on thetable.
“Young man,” he went on, raising his head again, “in your face I seem toread some trouble of mind. When you came in I read it, and that was whyI addressed you at once. For in unfolding to you the story of my life, Ido not wish to make myself a laughing-stock before these idle listeners,who indeed know all about it already, but I am looking for a manof feeling and education. Know then that my wife was educated in ahigh-class school for the daughters of noblemen, and on leaving shedanced the shawl dance before the governor and other personages forwhich she was presented with a gold medal and a certificate of merit.The medal... well, the medal of course was sold--long ago, hm... but thecertificate of merit is in her trunk still and not long ago she showedit to our landlady. And although she is most continually on bad termswith the landlady, yet she wanted to tell someone or other of her pasthonours and of the happy days that are gone. I don’t condemn her forit, I don’t blame her, for the one thing left her is recollection ofthe past, and all the rest is dust and ashes. Yes, yes, she is a ladyof spirit, proud and determined. She scrubs the floors herself and hasnothing but black bread to eat, but won’t allow herself to be treatedwith disrespect. That’s why she would not overlook Mr. Lebeziatnikov’srudeness to her, and so when he gave her a beating for it, she took toher bed more from the hurt to her feelings than from the blows. She wasa widow when I married her, with three children, one smaller than theother. She married her first husband, an infantry officer, for love, andran away with him from her father’s house. She was exceedingly fond ofher husband; but he gave way to cards, got into trouble and with that hedied. He used to beat her at the end: and although she paid him back, ofwhich I have authentic documentary evidence, to this day she speaks ofhim with tears and she throws him up to me; and I am glad, I am gladthat, though only in imagination, she should think of herself as havingonce been happy.... And she was left at his death with three children ina wild and remote district where I happened to be at the time; and shewas left in such hopeless poverty that, although I have seen many upsand downs of all sort, I don’t feel equal to describing it even. Herrelations had all thrown her off. And she was proud, too, excessivelyproud.... And then, honoured sir, and then, I, being at the time awidower, with a daughter of fourteen left me by my first wife, offeredher my hand, for I could not bear the sight of such suffering. You canjudge the extremity of her calamities, that she, a woman of educationand culture and distinguished family, should have consented to be mywife. But she did! Weeping and sobbing and wringing her hands, shemarried me! For she had nowhere to turn! Do you understand, sir, do youunderstand what it means when you have absolutely nowhere to turn? No,that you don’t understand yet.... And for a whole year, I performedmy duties conscientiously and faithfully, and did not touch this” (hetapped the jug with his finger), “for I have feelings. But even so, Icould not please her; and then I lost my place too, and that through nofault of mine but through changes in the office; and then I did touchit!... It will be a year and a half ago soon since we found ourselves atlast after many wanderings and numerous calamities in this magnificentcapital, adorned with innumerable monuments. Here I obtained asituation.... I obtained it and I lost it again. Do you understand? Thistime it was through my own fault I lost it: for my weakness had comeout.... We have now part of a room at Amalia Fyodorovna Lippevechsel’s;and what we live upon and what we pay our rent with, I could not say.There are a lot of people living there besides ourselves. Dirt anddisorder, a perfect Bedlam... hm... yes... And meanwhile my daughter bymy first wife has grown up; and what my daughter has had to put up withfrom her step-mother whilst she was growing up, I won’t speak of. For,though Katerina Ivanovna is full of generous feelings, she is a spiritedlady, irritable and short-tempered.... Yes. But it’s no use going overthat! Sonia, as you may well fancy, has had no education. I did make aneffort four years ago to give her a course of geography and universalhistory, but as I was not very well up in those subjects myself and wehad no suitable books, and what books we had... hm, anyway we have noteven those now, so all our instruction came to an end. We stopped atCyrus of Persia. Since she has attained years of maturity, she has readother books of romantic tendency and of late she had read with greatinterest a book she got through Mr. Lebeziatnikov, Lewes’ Physiology--doyou know it?--and even recounted extracts from it to us: and that’s thewhole of her education. And now may I venture to address you, honouredsir, on my own account with a private question. Do you suppose thata respectable poor girl can earn much by honest work? Not fifteenfarthings a day can she earn, if she is respectable and has no specialtalent and that without putting her work down for an instant! And what’smore, Ivan Ivanitch Klopstock the civil counsellor--have you heard ofhim?--has not to this day paid her for the half-dozen linen shirts shemade him and drove her roughly away, stamping and reviling her, on thepretext that the shirt collars were not made like the pattern and wereput in askew. And there are the little ones hungry.... And KaterinaIvanovna walking up and down and wringing her hands, her cheeks flushedred, as they always are in that disease: ‘Here you live with us,’ saysshe, ‘you eat and drink and are kept warm and you do nothing to help.’And much she gets to eat and drink when there is not a crust for thelittle ones for three days! I was lying at the time... well, what ofit! I was lying drunk and I heard my Sonia speaking (she is a gentlecreature with a soft little voice... fair hair and such a pale, thinlittle face). She said: ‘Katerina Ivanovna, am I really to do a thinglike that?’ And Darya Frantsovna, a woman of evil character and verywell known to the police, had two or three times tried to get at herthrough the landlady. ‘And why not?’ said Katerina Ivanovna with a jeer,‘you are something mighty precious to be so careful of!’ But don’t blameher, don’t blame her, honoured sir, don’t blame her! She was not herselfwhen she spoke, but driven to distraction by her illness and the cryingof the hungry children; and it was said more to wound her than anythingelse.... For that’s Katerina Ivanovna’s character, and when childrencry, even from hunger, she falls to beating them at once. At six o’clockI saw Sonia get up, put on her kerchief and her cape, and go out of theroom and about nine o’clock she came back. She walked straight up toKaterina Ivanovna and she laid thirty roubles on the table before herin silence. She did not utter a word, she did not even look at her, shesimply picked up our big green _drap de dames_ shawl (we have a shawl,made of _drap de dames_), put it over her head and face and lay downon the bed with her face to the wall; only her little shoulders and herbody kept shuddering.... And I went on lying there, just as before....And then I saw, young man, I saw Katerina Ivanovna, in the same silencego up to Sonia’s little bed; she was on her knees all the eveningkissing Sonia’s feet, and would not get up, and then they both fellasleep in each other’s arms... together, together... yes... and I... laydrunk.”
Marmeladov stopped short, as though his voice had failed him. Then hehurriedly filled his glass, drank, and cleared his throat.
“Since then, sir,” he went on after a brief pause--“Since then, owingto an unfortunate occurrence and through information given byevil-intentioned persons--in all which Darya Frantsovna took aleading part on the pretext that she had been treated with want ofrespect--since then my daughter Sofya Semyonovna has been forced to takea yellow ticket, and owing to that she is unable to go on living withus. For our landlady, Amalia Fyodorovna would not hear of it (thoughshe had backed up Darya Frantsovna before) and Mr. Lebeziatnikov too...hm.... All the trouble between him and Katerina Ivanovna was on Sonia’saccount. At first he was for making up to Sonia himself and then all ofa sudden he stood on his dignity: ‘how,’ said he, ‘can a highly educatedman like me live in the same rooms with a girl like that?’ And KaterinaIvanovna would not let it pass, she stood up for her... and so that’show it happened. And Sonia comes to us now, mostly after dark; shecomforts Katerina Ivanovna and gives her all she can.... She has a roomat the Kapernaumovs’ the tailors, she lodges with them; Kapernaumov isa lame man with a cleft palate and all of his numerous family have cleftpalates too. And his wife, too, has a cleft palate. They all live in oneroom, but Sonia has her own, partitioned off.... Hm... yes... very poorpeople and all with cleft palates... yes. Then I got up in the morning,and put on my rags, lifted up my hands to heaven and set off to hisexcellency Ivan Afanasyvitch. His excellency Ivan Afanasyvitch, do youknow him? No? Well, then, it’s a man of God you don’t know. He is wax...wax before the face of the Lord; even as wax melteth!... His eyes weredim when he heard my story. ‘Marmeladov, once already you havedeceived my expectations... I’ll take you once more on my ownresponsibility’--that’s what he said, ‘remember,’ he said, ‘and now youcan go.’ I kissed the dust at his feet--in thought only, for in realityhe would not have allowed me to do it, being a statesman and a man ofmodern political and enlightened ideas. I returned home, and when Iannounced that I’d been taken back into the service and should receive asalary, heavens, what a to-do there was!...”
Marmeladov stopped again in violent excitement. At that moment a wholeparty of revellers already drunk came in from the street, and the soundsof a hired concertina and the cracked piping voice of a child of sevensinging “The Hamlet” were heard in the entry. The room was filled withnoise. The tavern-keeper and the boys were busy with the new-comers.Marmeladov paying no attention to the new arrivals continued his story.He appeared by now to be extremely weak, but as he became more and moredrunk, he became more and more talkative. The recollection of hisrecent success in getting the situation seemed to revive him, and waspositively reflected in a sort of radiance on his face. Raskolnikovlistened attentively.
“That was five weeks ago, sir. Yes.... As soon as Katerina Ivanovnaand Sonia heard of it, mercy on us, it was as though I stepped into thekingdom of Heaven. It used to be: you can lie like a beast, nothing butabuse. Now they were walking on tiptoe, hushing the children. ‘SemyonZaharovitch is tired with his work at the office, he is resting, shh!’They made me coffee before I went to work and boiled cream for me! Theybegan to get real cream for me, do you hear that? And how they managedto get together the money for a decent outfit--eleven roubles, fiftycopecks, I can’t guess. Boots, cotton shirt-fronts--most magnificent,a uniform, they got up all in splendid style, for eleven roubles anda half. The first morning I came back from the office I found KaterinaIvanovna had cooked two courses for dinner--soup and salt meat withhorse radish--which we had never dreamed of till then. She had not anydresses... none at all, but she got herself up as though she were goingon a visit; and not that she’d anything to do it with, she smartenedherself up with nothing at all, she’d done her hair nicely, put on aclean collar of some sort, cuffs, and there she was, quite a differentperson, she was younger and better looking. Sonia, my little darling,had only helped with money ‘for the time,’ she said, ‘it won’t do for meto come and see you too often. After dark maybe when no one can see.’ Doyou hear, do you hear? I lay down for a nap after dinner and what do youthink: though Katerina Ivanovna had quarrelled to the last degree withour landlady Amalia Fyodorovna only a week before, she could notresist then asking her in to coffee. For two hours they were sitting,whispering together. ‘Semyon Zaharovitch is in the service again,now, and receiving a salary,’ says she, ‘and he went himself to hisexcellency and his excellency himself came out to him, made all theothers wait and led Semyon Zaharovitch by the hand before everybody intohis study.’ Do you hear, do you hear? ‘To be sure,’ says he, ‘SemyonZaharovitch, remembering your past services,’ says he, ‘and in spiteof your propensity to that foolish weakness, since you promise now andsince moreover we’ve got on badly without you,’ (do you hear, do youhear;) ‘and so,’ says he, ‘I rely now on your word as a gentleman.’ Andall that, let me tell you, she has simply made up for herself, and notsimply out of wantonness, for the sake of bragging; no, she believes itall herself, she amuses herself with her own fancies, upon my word shedoes! And I don’t blame her for it, no, I don’t blame her!... Six daysago when I brought her my first earnings in full--twenty-three roublesforty copecks altogether--she called me her poppet: ‘poppet,’ said she,‘my little poppet.’ And when we were by ourselves, you understand?You would not think me a beauty, you would not think much of me as ahusband, would you?... Well, she pinched my cheek, ‘my little poppet,’said she.”
Marmeladov broke off, tried to smile, but suddenly his chin beganto twitch. He controlled himself however. The tavern, the degradedappearance of the man, the five nights in the hay barge, and the pot ofspirits, and yet this poignant love for his wife and children bewilderedhis listener. Raskolnikov listened intently but with a sick sensation.He felt vexed that he had come here.
“Honoured sir, honoured sir,” cried Marmeladov recovering himself--“Oh,sir, perhaps all this seems a laughing matter to you, as it does toothers, and perhaps I am only worrying you with the stupidity of all thetrivial details of my home life, but it is not a laughing matter to me.For I can feel it all.... And the whole of that heavenly day of my lifeand the whole of that evening I passed in fleeting dreams of how I wouldarrange it all, and how I would dress all the children, and how I shouldgive her rest, and how I should rescue my own daughter from dishonourand restore her to the bosom of her family.... And a great deal more....Quite excusable, sir. Well, then, sir” (Marmeladov suddenly gave a sortof start, raised his head and gazed intently at his listener) “well, onthe very next day after all those dreams, that is to say, exactly fivedays ago, in the evening, by a cunning trick, like a thief in the night,I stole from Katerina Ivanovna the key of her box, took out what wasleft of my earnings, how much it was I have forgotten, and now lookat me, all of you! It’s the fifth day since I left home, and they arelooking for me there and it’s the end of my employment, and my uniformis lying in a tavern on the Egyptian bridge. I exchanged it for thegarments I have on... and it’s the end of everything!”
Marmeladov struck his forehead with his fist, clenched his teeth, closedhis eyes and leaned heavily with his elbow on the table. But a minutelater his face suddenly changed and with a certain assumed slyness andaffectation of bravado, he glanced at Raskolnikov, laughed and said:
“This morning I went to see Sonia, I went to ask her for a pick-me-up!He-he-he!”
“You don’t say she gave it to you?” cried one of the new-comers; heshouted the words and went off into a guffaw.
“This very quart was bought with her money,” Marmeladov declared,addressing himself exclusively to Raskolnikov. “Thirty copecks she gaveme with her own hands, her last, all she had, as I saw.... She saidnothing, she only looked at me without a word.... Not on earth, but upyonder... they grieve over men, they weep, but they don’t blame them,they don’t blame them! But it hurts more, it hurts more when they don’tblame! Thirty copecks yes! And maybe she needs them now, eh? What doyou think, my dear sir? For now she’s got to keep up her appearance. Itcosts money, that smartness, that special smartness, you know? Do youunderstand? And there’s pomatum, too, you see, she must have things;petticoats, starched ones, shoes, too, real jaunty ones to show off herfoot when she has to step over a puddle. Do you understand, sir, do youunderstand what all that smartness means? And here I, her own father,here I took thirty copecks of that money for a drink! And I am drinkingit! And I have already drunk it! Come, who will have pity on a man likeme, eh? Are you sorry for me, sir, or not? Tell me, sir, are you sorryor not? He-he-he!”
He would have filled his glass, but there was no drink left. The pot wasempty.
“What are you to be pitied for?” shouted the tavern-keeper who was againnear them.
Shouts of laughter and even oaths followed. The laughter and the oathscame from those who were listening and also from those who had heardnothing but were simply looking at the figure of the dischargedgovernment clerk.
“To be pitied! Why am I to be pitied?” Marmeladov suddenly declaimed,standing up with his arm outstretched, as though he had been onlywaiting for that question.
“Why am I to be pitied, you say? Yes! there’s nothing to pity me for! Iought to be crucified, crucified on a cross, not pitied! Crucify me,oh judge, crucify me but pity me! And then I will go of myself to becrucified, for it’s not merry-making I seek but tears and tribulation!...Do you suppose, you that sell, that this pint of yours has beensweet to me? It was tribulation I sought at the bottom of it, tears andtribulation, and have found it, and I have tasted it; but He will pityus Who has had pity on all men, Who has understood all men and allthings, He is the One, He too is the judge. He will come in that dayand He will ask: ‘Where is the daughter who gave herself for her cross,consumptive step-mother and for the little children of another? Where isthe daughter who had pity upon the filthy drunkard, her earthly father,undismayed by his beastliness?’ And He will say, ‘Come to me! I havealready forgiven thee once.... I have forgiven thee once.... Thy sinswhich are many are forgiven thee for thou hast loved much....’ And hewill forgive my Sonia, He will forgive, I know it... I felt it in myheart when I was with her just now! And He will judge and will forgiveall, the good and the evil, the wise and the meek.... And when He hasdone with all of them, then He will summon us. ‘You too come forth,’He will say, ‘Come forth ye drunkards, come forth, ye weak ones, comeforth, ye children of shame!’ And we shall all come forth, without shameand shall stand before him. And He will say unto us, ‘Ye are swine, madein the Image of the Beast and with his mark; but come ye also!’ And thewise ones and those of understanding will say, ‘Oh Lord, why dost Thoureceive these men?’ And He will say, ‘This is why I receive them, oh yewise, this is why I receive them, oh ye of understanding, that not oneof them believed himself to be worthy of this.’ And He will hold out Hishands to us and we shall fall down before him... and we shall weep...and we shall understand all things! Then we shall understand all!... andall will understand, Katerina Ivanovna even... she will understand....Lord, Thy kingdom come!” And he sank down on the bench exhausted, andhelpless, looking at no one, apparently oblivious of his surroundingsand plunged in deep thought. His words had created a certain impression;there was a moment of silence; but soon laughter and oaths were heardagain.
“That’s his notion!”
“Talked himself silly!”
“A fine clerk he is!”
And so on, and so on.
“Let us go, sir,” said Marmeladov all at once, raising his head andaddressing Raskolnikov--“come along with me... Kozel’s house, lookinginto the yard. I’m going to Katerina Ivanovna--time I did.”
Raskolnikov had for some time been wanting to go and he had meant tohelp him. Marmeladov was much unsteadier on his legs than in his speechand leaned heavily on the young man. They had two or three hundredpaces to go. The drunken man was more and more overcome by dismay andconfusion as they drew nearer the house.
“It’s not Katerina Ivanovna I am afraid of now,” he muttered inagitation--“and that she will begin pulling my hair. What does my hairmatter! Bother my hair! That’s what I say! Indeed it will be better ifshe does begin pulling it, that’s not what I am afraid of... it’s hereyes I am afraid of... yes, her eyes... the red on her cheeks, too,frightens me... and her breathing too.... Have you noticed how peoplein that disease breathe... when they are excited? I am frightened ofthe children’s crying, too.... For if Sonia has not taken them food...I don’t know what’s happened! I don’t know! But blows I am not afraidof.... Know, sir, that such blows are not a pain to me, but even anenjoyment. In fact I can’t get on without it.... It’s better so. Lether strike me, it relieves her heart... it’s better so... There is thehouse. The house of Kozel, the cabinet-maker... a German, well-to-do.Lead the way!”
They went in from the yard and up to the fourth storey. The staircasegot darker and darker as they went up. It was nearly eleven o’clockand although in summer in Petersburg there is no real night, yet it wasquite dark at the top of the stairs.
A grimy little door at the very top of the stairs stood ajar. A verypoor-looking room about ten paces long was lighted up by a candle-end;the whole of it was visible from the entrance. It was all in disorder,littered up with rags of all sorts, especially children’s garments.Across the furthest corner was stretched a ragged sheet. Behind itprobably was the bed. There was nothing in the room except two chairsand a sofa covered with American leather, full of holes, before whichstood an old deal kitchen-table, unpainted and uncovered. At the edgeof the table stood a smoldering tallow-candle in an iron candlestick. Itappeared that the family had a room to themselves, not part of a room,but their room was practically a passage. The door leading to the otherrooms, or rather cupboards, into which Amalia Lippevechsel’s flat wasdivided stood half open, and there was shouting, uproar and laughterwithin. People seemed to be playing cards and drinking tea there. Wordsof the most unceremonious kind flew out from time to time.
Raskolnikov recognised Katerina Ivanovna at once. She was a rather tall,slim and graceful woman, terribly emaciated, with magnificent dark brownhair and with a hectic flush in her cheeks. She was pacing up and downin her little room, pressing her hands against her chest; her lipswere parched and her breathing came in nervous broken gasps. Her eyesglittered as in fever and looked about with a harsh immovable stare. Andthat consumptive and excited face with the last flickering light of thecandle-end playing upon it made a sickening impression. She seemed toRaskolnikov about thirty years old and was certainly a strange wife forMarmeladov.... She had not heard them and did not notice them coming in.She seemed to be lost in thought, hearing and seeing nothing. The roomwas close, but she had not opened the window; a stench rose from thestaircase, but the door on to the stairs was not closed. From the innerrooms clouds of tobacco smoke floated in, she kept coughing, but did notclose the door. The youngest child, a girl of six, was asleep, sittingcurled up on the floor with her head on the sofa. A boy a year olderstood crying and shaking in the corner, probably he had just had abeating. Beside him stood a girl of nine years old, tall and thin,wearing a thin and ragged chemise with an ancient cashmere pelisse flungover her bare shoulders, long outgrown and barely reaching her knees.Her arm, as thin as a stick, was round her brother’s neck. She wastrying to comfort him, whispering something to him, and doing all shecould to keep him from whimpering again. At the same time her largedark eyes, which looked larger still from the thinness of her frightenedface, were watching her mother with alarm. Marmeladov did not enter thedoor, but dropped on his knees in the very doorway, pushing Raskolnikovin front of him. The woman seeing a stranger stopped indifferentlyfacing him, coming to herself for a moment and apparently wondering whathe had come for. But evidently she decided that he was going intothe next room, as he had to pass through hers to get there. Taking nofurther notice of him, she walked towards the outer door to close itand uttered a sudden scream on seeing her husband on his knees in thedoorway.
“Ah!” she cried out in a frenzy, “he has come back! The criminal! themonster!... And where is the money? What’s in your pocket, show me! Andyour clothes are all different! Where are your clothes? Where is themoney! Speak!”
And she fell to searching him. Marmeladov submissively and obedientlyheld up both arms to facilitate the search. Not a farthing was there.
“Where is the money?” she cried--“Mercy on us, can he have drunk it all?There were twelve silver roubles left in the chest!” and in a furyshe seized him by the hair and dragged him into the room. Marmeladovseconded her efforts by meekly crawling along on his knees.
“And this is a consolation to me! This does not hurt me, but is apositive con-so-la-tion, ho-nou-red sir,” he called out, shaken to andfro by his hair and even once striking the ground with his forehead.The child asleep on the floor woke up, and began to cry. The boy in thecorner losing all control began trembling and screaming and rushedto his sister in violent terror, almost in a fit. The eldest girl wasshaking like a leaf.
“He’s drunk it! he’s drunk it all,” the poor woman screamed indespair--“and his clothes are gone! And they are hungry, hungry!”--andwringing her hands she pointed to the children. “Oh, accursed life!And you, are you not ashamed?”--she pounced all at once uponRaskolnikov--“from the tavern! Have you been drinking with him? You havebeen drinking with him, too! Go away!”
The young man was hastening away without uttering a word. The inner doorwas thrown wide open and inquisitive faces were peering in at it. Coarselaughing faces with pipes and cigarettes and heads wearing caps thrustthemselves in at the doorway. Further in could be seen figures indressing gowns flung open, in costumes of unseemly scantiness, some ofthem with cards in their hands. They were particularly diverted, whenMarmeladov, dragged about by his hair, shouted that it was a consolationto him. They even began to come into the room; at last a sinister shrilloutcry was heard: this came from Amalia Lippevechsel herself pushing herway amongst them and trying to restore order after her own fashion andfor the hundredth time to frighten the poor woman by ordering herwith coarse abuse to clear out of the room next day. As he went out,Raskolnikov had time to put his hand into his pocket, to snatch up thecoppers he had received in exchange for his rouble in the tavern and tolay them unnoticed on the window. Afterwards on the stairs, he changedhis mind and would have gone back.
“What a stupid thing I’ve done,” he thought to himself, “they have Soniaand I want it myself.” But reflecting that it would be impossible totake it back now and that in any case he would not have taken it, hedismissed it with a wave of his hand and went back to his lodging.“Sonia wants pomatum too,” he said as he walked along the street, and helaughed malignantly--“such smartness costs money.... Hm! And maybe Soniaherself will be bankrupt to-day, for there is always a risk, huntingbig game... digging for gold... then they would all be without a crustto-morrow except for my money. Hurrah for Sonia! What a mine they’ve dugthere! And they’re making the most of it! Yes, they are making the mostof it! They’ve wept over it and grown used to it. Man grows used toeverything, the scoundrel!”
He sank into thought.
“And what if I am wrong,” he cried suddenly after a moment’s thought.“What if man is not really a scoundrel, man in general, I mean, thewhole race of mankind--then all the rest is prejudice, simply artificialterrors and there are no barriers and it’s all as it should be.”
CHAPTER III
He waked up late next day after a broken sleep. But his sleep had notrefreshed him; he waked up bilious, irritable, ill-tempered, and lookedwith hatred at his room. It was a tiny cupboard of a room about sixpaces in length. It had a poverty-stricken appearance with its dustyyellow paper peeling off the walls, and it was so low-pitched that a manof more than average height was ill at ease in it and felt every momentthat he would knock his head against the ceiling. The furniture was inkeeping with the room: there were three old chairs, rather rickety; apainted table in the corner on which lay a few manuscripts and books;the dust that lay thick upon them showed that they had been longuntouched. A big clumsy sofa occupied almost the whole of one wall andhalf the floor space of the room; it was once covered with chintz, butwas now in rags and served Raskolnikov as a bed. Often he went to sleepon it, as he was, without undressing, without sheets, wrapped in his oldstudent’s overcoat, with his head on one little pillow, under which heheaped up all the linen he had, clean and dirty, by way of a bolster. Alittle table stood in front of the sofa.
It would have been difficult to sink to a lower ebb of disorder, but toRaskolnikov in his present state of mind this was positively agreeable.He had got completely away from everyone, like a tortoise in its shell,and even the sight of a servant girl who had to wait upon him and lookedsometimes into his room made him writhe with nervous irritation. He wasin the condition that overtakes some monomaniacs entirely concentratedupon one thing. His landlady had for the last fortnight given up sendinghim in meals, and he had not yet thought of expostulating with her,though he went without his dinner. Nastasya, the cook and only servant,was rather pleased at the lodger’s mood and had entirely given upsweeping and doing his room, only once a week or so she would stray intohis room with a broom. She waked him up that day.
“Get up, why are you asleep?” she called to him. “It’s past nine, I havebrought you some tea; will you have a cup? I should think you’re fairlystarving?”
Raskolnikov opened his eyes, started and recognised Nastasya.
“From the landlady, eh?” he asked, slowly and with a sickly face sittingup on the sofa.
“From the landlady, indeed!”
She set before him her own cracked teapot full of weak and stale tea andlaid two yellow lumps of sugar by the side of it.
“Here, Nastasya, take it please,” he said, fumbling in his pocket (forhe had slept in his clothes) and taking out a handful of coppers--“runand buy me a loaf. And get me a little sausage, the cheapest, at thepork-butcher’s.”
“The loaf I’ll fetch you this very minute, but wouldn’t you rather havesome cabbage soup instead of sausage? It’s capital soup, yesterday’s. Isaved it for you yesterday, but you came in late. It’s fine soup.”
When the soup had been brought, and he had begun upon it, Nastasyasat down beside him on the sofa and began chatting. She was a countrypeasant-woman and a very talkative one.
“Praskovya Pavlovna means to complain to the police about you,” shesaid.
He scowled.
“To the police? What does she want?”
“You don’t pay her money and you won’t turn out of the room. That’s whatshe wants, to be sure.”
“The devil, that’s the last straw,” he muttered, grinding his teeth,“no, that would not suit me... just now. She is a fool,” he added aloud.“I’ll go and talk to her to-day.”
“Fool she is and no mistake, just as I am. But why, if you are soclever, do you lie here like a sack and have nothing to show for it? Onetime you used to go out, you say, to teach children. But why is it youdo nothing now?”
“I am doing...” Raskolnikov began sullenly and reluctantly.
“What are you doing?”
“Work...”
“What sort of work?”
“I am thinking,” he answered seriously after a pause.
Nastasya was overcome with a fit of laughter. She was given to laughterand when anything amused her, she laughed inaudibly, quivering andshaking all over till she felt ill.
“And have you made much money by your thinking?” she managed toarticulate at last.
“One can’t go out to give lessons without boots. And I’m sick of it.”
“Don’t quarrel with your bread and butter.”
“They pay so little for lessons. What’s the use of a few coppers?” heanswered, reluctantly, as though replying to his own thought.
“And you want to get a fortune all at once?”
He looked at her strangely.
“Yes, I want a fortune,” he answered firmly, after a brief pause.
“Don’t be in such a hurry, you quite frighten me! Shall I get you theloaf or not?”
“As you please.”
“Ah, I forgot! A letter came for you yesterday when you were out.”
“A letter? for me! from whom?”
“I can’t say. I gave three copecks of my own to the postman for it. Willyou pay me back?”
“Then bring it to me, for God’s sake, bring it,” cried Raskolnikovgreatly excited--“good God!”
A minute later the letter was brought him. That was it: from his mother,from the province of R----. He turned pale when he took it. It was along while since he had received a letter, but another feeling alsosuddenly stabbed his heart.
“Nastasya, leave me alone, for goodness’ sake; here are your threecopecks, but for goodness’ sake, make haste and go!”
The letter was quivering in his hand; he did not want to open it in herpresence; he wanted to be left _alone_ with this letter. When Nastasyahad gone out, he lifted it quickly to his lips and kissed it; then hegazed intently at the address, the small, sloping handwriting, so dearand familiar, of the mother who had once taught him to read and write.He delayed; he seemed almost afraid of something. At last he opened it;it was a thick heavy letter, weighing over two ounces, two large sheetsof note paper were covered with very small handwriting.
“My dear Rodya,” wrote his mother--“it’s two months since I last had atalk with you by letter which has distressed me and even kept meawake at night, thinking. But I am sure you will not blame me for myinevitable silence. You know how I love you; you are all we have to lookto, Dounia and I, you are our all, our one hope, our one stay. What agrief it was to me when I heard that you had given up the universitysome months ago, for want of means to keep yourself and that you hadlost your lessons and your other work! How could I help you out of myhundred and twenty roubles a year pension? The fifteen roubles I sentyou four months ago I borrowed, as you know, on security of my pension,from Vassily Ivanovitch Vahrushin a merchant of this town. He is akind-hearted man and was a friend of your father’s too. But having givenhim the right to receive the pension, I had to wait till the debt waspaid off and that is only just done, so that I’ve been unable to sendyou anything all this time. But now, thank God, I believe I shallbe able to send you something more and in fact we may congratulateourselves on our good fortune now, of which I hasten to inform you. Inthe first place, would you have guessed, dear Rodya, that your sisterhas been living with me for the last six weeks and we shall not beseparated in the future. Thank God, her sufferings are over, but I willtell you everything in order, so that you may know just how everythinghas happened and all that we have hitherto concealed from you. When youwrote to me two months ago that you had heard that Dounia had a greatdeal to put up with in the Svidrigaïlovs’ house, when you wrote thatand asked me to tell you all about it--what could I write in answer toyou? If I had written the whole truth to you, I dare say you would havethrown up everything and have come to us, even if you had to walk allthe way, for I know your character and your feelings, and you would notlet your sister be insulted. I was in despair myself, but what could Ido? And, besides, I did not know the whole truth myself then. Whatmade it all so difficult was that Dounia received a hundred roublesin advance when she took the place as governess in their family, oncondition of part of her salary being deducted every month, and so itwas impossible to throw up the situation without repaying the debt.This sum (now I can explain it all to you, my precious Rodya) she tookchiefly in order to send you sixty roubles, which you needed so terriblythen and which you received from us last year. We deceived you then,writing that this money came from Dounia’s savings, but that was notso, and now I tell you all about it, because, thank God, things havesuddenly changed for the better, and that you may know how Dounia lovesyou and what a heart she has. At first indeed Mr. Svidrigaïlov treatedher very rudely and used to make disrespectful and jeering remarks attable.... But I don’t want to go into all those painful details, so asnot to worry you for nothing when it is now all over. In short, in spiteof the kind and generous behaviour of Marfa Petrovna, Mr. Svidrigaïlov’swife, and all the rest of the household, Dounia had a very hard time,especially when Mr. Svidrigaïlov, relapsing into his old regimentalhabits, was under the influence of Bacchus. And how do you think itwas all explained later on? Would you believe that the crazy fellow hadconceived a passion for Dounia from the beginning, but had concealedit under a show of rudeness and contempt. Possibly he was ashamed andhorrified himself at his own flighty hopes, considering his years andhis being the father of a family; and that made him angry with Dounia.And possibly, too, he hoped by his rude and sneering behaviour to hidethe truth from others. But at last he lost all control and had the faceto make Dounia an open and shameful proposal, promising her all sorts ofinducements and offering, besides, to throw up everything and take herto another estate of his, or even abroad. You can imagine all she wentthrough! To leave her situation at once was impossible not only onaccount of the money debt, but also to spare the feelings of MarfaPetrovna, whose suspicions would have been aroused: and then Douniawould have been the cause of a rupture in the family. And it wouldhave meant a terrible scandal for Dounia too; that would have beeninevitable. There were various other reasons owing to which Dounia couldnot hope to escape from that awful house for another six weeks. You knowDounia, of course; you know how clever she is and what a strong will shehas. Dounia can endure a great deal and even in the most difficult casesshe has the fortitude to maintain her firmness. She did not even writeto me about everything for fear of upsetting me, although we wereconstantly in communication. It all ended very unexpectedly. MarfaPetrovna accidentally overheard her husband imploring Dounia in thegarden, and, putting quite a wrong interpretation on the position, threwthe blame upon her, believing her to be the cause of it all. An awfulscene took place between them on the spot in the garden; Marfa Petrovnawent so far as to strike Dounia, refused to hear anything and wasshouting at her for a whole hour and then gave orders that Dounia shouldbe packed off at once to me in a plain peasant’s cart, into which theyflung all her things, her linen and her clothes, all pell-mell, withoutfolding it up and packing it. And a heavy shower of rain came on, too,and Dounia, insulted and put to shame, had to drive with a peasant in anopen cart all the seventeen versts into town. Only think now what answercould I have sent to the letter I received from you two months ago andwhat could I have written? I was in despair; I dared not write toyou the truth because you would have been very unhappy, mortifiedand indignant, and yet what could you do? You could only perhaps ruinyourself, and, besides, Dounia would not allow it; and fill up my letterwith trifles when my heart was so full of sorrow, I could not. For awhole month the town was full of gossip about this scandal, and it cameto such a pass that Dounia and I dared not even go to church on accountof the contemptuous looks, whispers, and even remarks made aloud aboutus. All our acquaintances avoided us, nobody even bowed to us in thestreet, and I learnt that some shopmen and clerks were intending toinsult us in a shameful way, smearing the gates of our house with pitch,so that the landlord began to tell us we must leave. All this was setgoing by Marfa Petrovna who managed to slander Dounia and throw dirt ather in every family. She knows everyone in the neighbourhood, and thatmonth she was continually coming into the town, and as she israther talkative and fond of gossiping about her family affairs andparticularly of complaining to all and each of her husband--which is notat all right--so in a short time she had spread her story not only inthe town, but over the whole surrounding district. It made me ill, butDounia bore it better than I did, and if only you could have seen howshe endured it all and tried to comfort me and cheer me up! She isan angel! But by God’s mercy, our sufferings were cut short: Mr.Svidrigaïlov returned to his senses and repented and, probablyfeeling sorry for Dounia, he laid before Marfa Petrovna a complete andunmistakable proof of Dounia’s innocence, in the form of a letter Douniahad been forced to write and give to him, before Marfa Petrovnacame upon them in the garden. This letter, which remained in Mr.Svidrigaïlov’s hands after her departure, she had written to refusepersonal explanations and secret interviews, for which he was entreatingher. In that letter she reproached him with great heat and indignationfor the baseness of his behaviour in regard to Marfa Petrovna, remindinghim that he was the father and head of a family and telling him howinfamous it was of him to torment and make unhappy a defenceless girl,unhappy enough already. Indeed, dear Rodya, the letter was so nobly andtouchingly written that I sobbed when I read it and to this day I cannotread it without tears. Moreover, the evidence of the servants, too,cleared Dounia’s reputation; they had seen and known a great deal morethan Mr. Svidrigaïlov had himself supposed--as indeed is always the casewith servants. Marfa Petrovna was completely taken aback, and ‘againcrushed’ as she said herself to us, but she was completely convinced ofDounia’s innocence. The very next day, being Sunday, she went straightto the Cathedral, knelt down and prayed with tears to Our Lady to giveher strength to bear this new trial and to do her duty. Then shecame straight from the Cathedral to us, told us the whole story, weptbitterly and, fully penitent, she embraced Dounia and besought her toforgive her. The same morning without any delay, she went round to allthe houses in the town and everywhere, shedding tears, she asserted inthe most flattering terms Dounia’s innocence and the nobility ofher feelings and her behavior. What was more, she showed and read toeveryone the letter in Dounia’s own handwriting to Mr. Svidrigaïlov andeven allowed them to take copies of it--which I must say I think wassuperfluous. In this way she was busy for several days in driving aboutthe whole town, because some people had taken offence through precedencehaving been given to others. And therefore they had to take turns, sothat in every house she was expected before she arrived, and everyoneknew that on such and such a day Marfa Petrovna would be reading theletter in such and such a place and people assembled for every readingof it, even many who had heard it several times already both in theirown houses and in other people’s. In my opinion a great deal, a verygreat deal of all this was unnecessary; but that’s Marfa Petrovna’scharacter. Anyway she succeeded in completely re-establishing Dounia’sreputation and the whole ignominy of this affair rested as an indelibledisgrace upon her husband, as the only person to blame, so that I reallybegan to feel sorry for him; it was really treating the crazy fellow tooharshly. Dounia was at once asked to give lessons in several families,but she refused. All of a sudden everyone began to treat her with markedrespect and all this did much to bring about the event by which, one maysay, our whole fortunes are now transformed. You must know, dear Rodya,that Dounia has a suitor and that she has already consented to marryhim. I hasten to tell you all about the matter, and though it has beenarranged without asking your consent, I think you will not be aggrievedwith me or with your sister on that account, for you will see that wecould not wait and put off our decision till we heard from you. And youcould not have judged all the facts without being on the spot. Thiswas how it happened. He is already of the rank of a counsellor, PyotrPetrovitch Luzhin, and is distantly related to Marfa Petrovna, whohas been very active in bringing the match about. It began with hisexpressing through her his desire to make our acquaintance. He wasproperly received, drank coffee with us and the very next day he sentus a letter in which he very courteously made an offer and begged for aspeedy and decided answer. He is a very busy man and is in a great hurryto get to Petersburg, so that every moment is precious to him. At first,of course, we were greatly surprised, as it had all happened so quicklyand unexpectedly. We thought and talked it over the whole day. He is awell-to-do man, to be depended upon, he has two posts in the governmentand has already made his fortune. It is true that he is forty-five yearsold, but he is of a fairly prepossessing appearance and might still bethought attractive by women, and he is altogether a very respectable andpresentable man, only he seems a little morose and somewhat conceited.But possibly that may only be the impression he makes at first sight.And beware, dear Rodya, when he comes to Petersburg, as he shortly willdo, beware of judging him too hastily and severely, as your way is, ifthere is anything you do not like in him at first sight. I give you thiswarning, although I feel sure that he will make a favourable impressionupon you. Moreover, in order to understand any man one must bedeliberate and careful to avoid forming prejudices and mistaken ideas,which are very difficult to correct and get over afterwards. And PyotrPetrovitch, judging by many indications, is a thoroughly estimable man.At his first visit, indeed, he told us that he was a practical man, butstill he shares, as he expressed it, many of the convictions ‘of ourmost rising generation’ and he is an opponent of all prejudices. Hesaid a good deal more, for he seems a little conceited and likes to belistened to, but this is scarcely a vice. I, of course, understood verylittle of it, but Dounia explained to me that, though he is not a manof great education, he is clever and seems to be good-natured. You knowyour sister’s character, Rodya. She is a resolute, sensible, patient andgenerous girl, but she has a passionate heart, as I know very well.Of course, there is no great love either on his side, or on hers, butDounia is a clever girl and has the heart of an angel, and will makeit her duty to make her husband happy who on his side will make herhappiness his care. Of that we have no good reason to doubt, though itmust be admitted the matter has been arranged in great haste. Besides heis a man of great prudence and he will see, to be sure, of himself, thathis own happiness will be the more secure, the happier Dounia is withhim. And as for some defects of character, for some habits and evencertain differences of opinion--which indeed are inevitable even inthe happiest marriages--Dounia has said that, as regards all that, sherelies on herself, that there is nothing to be uneasy about, andthat she is ready to put up with a great deal, if only their futurerelationship can be an honourable and straightforward one. He struck me,for instance, at first, as rather abrupt, but that may well comefrom his being an outspoken man, and that is no doubt how it is. Forinstance, at his second visit, after he had received Dounia’s consent,in the course of conversation, he declared that before makingDounia’s acquaintance, he had made up his mind to marry a girl ofgood reputation, without dowry and, above all, one who had experiencedpoverty, because, as he explained, a man ought not to be indebted to hiswife, but that it is better for a wife to look upon her husband as herbenefactor. I must add that he expressed it more nicely and politelythan I have done, for I have forgotten his actual phrases and onlyremember the meaning. And, besides, it was obviously not said of design,but slipped out in the heat of conversation, so that he tried afterwardsto correct himself and smooth it over, but all the same it did strikeme as somewhat rude, and I said so afterwards to Dounia. But Dounia wasvexed, and answered that ‘words are not deeds,’ and that, of course, isperfectly true. Dounia did not sleep all night before she made upher mind, and, thinking that I was asleep, she got out of bed and waswalking up and down the room all night; at last she knelt down beforethe ikon and prayed long and fervently and in the morning she told methat she had decided.
“I have mentioned already that Pyotr Petrovitch is just setting off forPetersburg, where he has a great deal of business, and he wants to opena legal bureau. He has been occupied for many years in conducting civiland commercial litigation, and only the other day he won an importantcase. He has to be in Petersburg because he has an important case beforethe Senate. So, Rodya dear, he may be of the greatest use to you, inevery way indeed, and Dounia and I have agreed that from this very dayyou could definitely enter upon your career and might consider thatyour future is marked out and assured for you. Oh, if only this comes topass! This would be such a benefit that we could only look upon it as aprovidential blessing. Dounia is dreaming of nothing else. We have evenventured already to drop a few words on the subject to Pyotr Petrovitch.He was cautious in his answer, and said that, of course, as he could notget on without a secretary, it would be better to be paying a salary toa relation than to a stranger, if only the former were fitted for theduties (as though there could be doubt of your being fitted!) but thenhe expressed doubts whether your studies at the university would leaveyou time for work at his office. The matter dropped for the time, butDounia is thinking of nothing else now. She has been in a sort of feverfor the last few days, and has already made a regular plan foryour becoming in the end an associate and even a partner in PyotrPetrovitch’s business, which might well be, seeing that you are astudent of law. I am in complete agreement with her, Rodya, and shareall her plans and hopes, and think there is every probability ofrealising them. And in spite of Pyotr Petrovitch’s evasiveness, verynatural at present (since he does not know you), Dounia is firmlypersuaded that she will gain everything by her good influence over herfuture husband; this she is reckoning upon. Of course we are carefulnot to talk of any of these more remote plans to Pyotr Petrovitch,especially of your becoming his partner. He is a practical man and mighttake this very coldly, it might all seem to him simply a day-dream. Norhas either Dounia or I breathed a word to him of the great hopes we haveof his helping us to pay for your university studies; we have not spokenof it in the first place, because it will come to pass of itself,later on, and he will no doubt without wasting words offer to do it ofhimself, (as though he could refuse Dounia that) the more readily sinceyou may by your own efforts become his right hand in the office, andreceive this assistance not as a charity, but as a salary earned by yourown work. Dounia wants to arrange it all like this and I quite agreewith her. And we have not spoken of our plans for another reason, thatis, because I particularly wanted you to feel on an equal footing whenyou first meet him. When Dounia spoke to him with enthusiasm aboutyou, he answered that one could never judge of a man without seeinghim close, for oneself, and that he looked forward to forming his ownopinion when he makes your acquaintance. Do you know, my preciousRodya, I think that perhaps for some reasons (nothing to do with PyotrPetrovitch though, simply for my own personal, perhaps old-womanish,fancies) I should do better to go on living by myself, apart, than withthem, after the wedding. I am convinced that he will be generous anddelicate enough to invite me and to urge me to remain with my daughterfor the future, and if he has said nothing about it hitherto, it issimply because it has been taken for granted; but I shall refuse. I havenoticed more than once in my life that husbands don’t quite get on withtheir mothers-in-law, and I don’t want to be the least bit in anyone’sway, and for my own sake, too, would rather be quite independent, solong as I have a crust of bread of my own, and such children as you andDounia. If possible, I would settle somewhere near you, for the mostjoyful piece of news, dear Rodya, I have kept for the end of my letter:know then, my dear boy, that we may, perhaps, be all together in avery short time and may embrace one another again after a separation ofalmost three years! It is settled _for certain_ that Dounia and I are toset off for Petersburg, exactly when I don’t know, but very, very soon,possibly in a week. It all depends on Pyotr Petrovitch who will let usknow when he has had time to look round him in Petersburg. To suit hisown arrangements he is anxious to have the ceremony as soon as possible,even before the fast of Our Lady, if it could be managed, or if that istoo soon to be ready, immediately after. Oh, with what happiness I shallpress you to my heart! Dounia is all excitement at the joyful thoughtof seeing you, she said one day in joke that she would be ready to marryPyotr Petrovitch for that alone. She is an angel! She is not writinganything to you now, and has only told me to write that she has so much,so much to tell you that she is not going to take up her pen now, fora few lines would tell you nothing, and it would only mean upsettingherself; she bids me send you her love and innumerable kisses. Butalthough we shall be meeting so soon, perhaps I shall send you as muchmoney as I can in a day or two. Now that everyone has heard that Douniais to marry Pyotr Petrovitch, my credit has suddenly improved and I knowthat Afanasy Ivanovitch will trust me now even to seventy-five roubleson the security of my pension, so that perhaps I shall be able to sendyou twenty-five or even thirty roubles. I would send you more, but I amuneasy about our travelling expenses; for though Pyotr Petrovitch hasbeen so kind as to undertake part of the expenses of the journey, thatis to say, he has taken upon himself the conveyance of our bags and bigtrunk (which will be conveyed through some acquaintances of his), wemust reckon upon some expense on our arrival in Petersburg, where wecan’t be left without a halfpenny, at least for the first few days. Butwe have calculated it all, Dounia and I, to the last penny, and we seethat the journey will not cost very much. It is only ninety versts fromus to the railway and we have come to an agreement with a driver weknow, so as to be in readiness; and from there Dounia and I can travelquite comfortably third class. So that I may very likely be able to sendto you not twenty-five, but thirty roubles. But enough; I have coveredtwo sheets already and there is no space left for more; our wholehistory, but so many events have happened! And now, my precious Rodya,I embrace you and send you a mother’s blessing till we meet. Love Douniayour sister, Rodya; love her as she loves you and understand that sheloves you beyond everything, more than herself. She is an angel and you,Rodya, you are everything to us--our one hope, our one consolation. Ifonly you are happy, we shall be happy. Do you still say your prayers,Rodya, and believe in the mercy of our Creator and our Redeemer? I amafraid in my heart that you may have been visited by the new spirit ofinfidelity that is abroad to-day; If it is so, I pray for you. Remember,dear boy, how in your childhood, when your father was living, you usedto lisp your prayers at my knee, and how happy we all were in thosedays. Good-bye, till we meet then--I embrace you warmly, warmly, withmany kisses.
“Yours till death,
“PULCHERIA RASKOLNIKOV.”
Almost from the first, while he read the letter, Raskolnikov’s face waswet with tears; but when he finished it, his face was pale and distortedand a bitter, wrathful and malignant smile was on his lips. He laid hishead down on his threadbare dirty pillow and pondered, pondered a longtime. His heart was beating violently, and his brain was in a turmoil.At last he felt cramped and stifled in the little yellow room that waslike a cupboard or a box. His eyes and his mind craved for space. Hetook up his hat and went out, this time without dread of meetinganyone; he had forgotten his dread. He turned in the direction of theVassilyevsky Ostrov, walking along Vassilyevsky Prospect, as thoughhastening on some business, but he walked, as his habit was, withoutnoticing his way, muttering and even speaking aloud to himself, to theastonishment of the passers-by. Many of them took him to be drunk.
CHAPTER IV
His mother’s letter had been a torture to him, but as regards the chieffact in it, he had felt not one moment’s hesitation, even whilst he wasreading the letter. The essential question was settled, and irrevocablysettled, in his mind: “Never such a marriage while I am alive andMr. Luzhin be damned!” “The thing is perfectly clear,” he mutteredto himself, with a malignant smile anticipating the triumph of hisdecision. “No, mother, no, Dounia, you won’t deceive me! and then theyapologise for not asking my advice and for taking the decision withoutme! I dare say! They imagine it is arranged now and can’t be brokenoff; but we will see whether it can or not! A magnificent excuse:‘Pyotr Petrovitch is such a busy man that even his wedding has to be inpost-haste, almost by express.’ No, Dounia, I see it all and I know whatyou want to say to me; and I know too what you were thinking about, whenyou walked up and down all night, and what your prayers were like beforethe Holy Mother of Kazan who stands in mother’s bedroom. Bitter isthe ascent to Golgotha.... Hm... so it is finally settled; you havedetermined to marry a sensible business man, Avdotya Romanovna, onewho has a fortune (has _already_ made his fortune, that is so muchmore solid and impressive), a man who holds two government posts and whoshares the ideas of our most rising generation, as mother writes, andwho _seems_ to be kind, as Dounia herself observes. That _seems_ beatseverything! And that very Dounia for that very ‘_seems_’ is marryinghim! Splendid! splendid!
“... But I should like to know why mother has written to me about ‘ourmost rising generation’? Simply as a descriptive touch, or with the ideaof prepossessing me in favour of Mr. Luzhin? Oh, the cunning of them!I should like to know one thing more: how far they were open with oneanother that day and night and all this time since? Was it all put into_words_, or did both understand that they had the same thing at heartand in their minds, so that there was no need to speak of it aloud, andbetter not to speak of it. Most likely it was partly like that, frommother’s letter it’s evident: he struck her as rude _a little_, andmother in her simplicity took her observations to Dounia. And she wassure to be vexed and ‘answered her angrily.’ I should think so! Whowould not be angered when it was quite clear without any naïve questionsand when it was understood that it was useless to discuss it. And whydoes she write to me, ‘love Dounia, Rodya, and she loves you more thanherself’? Has she a secret conscience-prick at sacrificing her daughterto her son? ‘You are our one comfort, you are everything to us.’ Oh,mother!”
His bitterness grew more and more intense, and if he had happened tomeet Mr. Luzhin at the moment, he might have murdered him.
“Hm... yes, that’s true,” he continued, pursuing the whirling ideas thatchased each other in his brain, “it is true that ‘it needs time and careto get to know a man,’ but there is no mistake about Mr. Luzhin. Thechief thing is he is ‘a man of business and _seems_ kind,’ that wassomething, wasn’t it, to send the bags and big box for them! A kind man,no doubt after that! But his _bride_ and her mother are to drive in apeasant’s cart covered with sacking (I know, I have been driven init). No matter! It is only ninety versts and then they can ‘travel verycomfortably, third class,’ for a thousand versts! Quite right, too. Onemust cut one’s coat according to one’s cloth, but what about you, Mr.Luzhin? She is your bride.... And you must be aware that her mother hasto raise money on her pension for the journey. To be sure it’s a matterof business, a partnership for mutual benefit, with equal shares andexpenses;--food and drink provided, but pay for your tobacco. Thebusiness man has got the better of them, too. The luggage will cost lessthan their fares and very likely go for nothing. How is it that theydon’t both see all that, or is it that they don’t want to see? Andthey are pleased, pleased! And to think that this is only the firstblossoming, and that the real fruits are to come! But what reallymatters is not the stinginess, is not the meanness, but the _tone_of the whole thing. For that will be the tone after marriage, it’s aforetaste of it. And mother too, why should she be so lavish? What willshe have by the time she gets to Petersburg? Three silver roubles ortwo ‘paper ones’ as _she_ says.... that old woman... hm. What doesshe expect to live upon in Petersburg afterwards? She has her reasonsalready for guessing that she _could not_ live with Dounia after themarriage, even for the first few months. The good man has no doubt letslip something on that subject also, though mother would deny it: ‘Ishall refuse,’ says she. On whom is she reckoning then? Is she countingon what is left of her hundred and twenty roubles of pension whenAfanasy Ivanovitch’s debt is paid? She knits woollen shawls andembroiders cuffs, ruining her old eyes. And all her shawls don’t addmore than twenty roubles a year to her hundred and twenty, I knowthat. So she is building all her hopes all the time on Mr. Luzhin’sgenerosity; ‘he will offer it of himself, he will press it on me.’You may wait a long time for that! That’s how it always is with theseSchilleresque noble hearts; till the last moment every goose is a swanwith them, till the last moment, they hope for the best and will seenothing wrong, and although they have an inkling of the other side ofthe picture, yet they won’t face the truth till they are forced to; thevery thought of it makes them shiver; they thrust the truth away withboth hands, until the man they deck out in false colours puts a fool’scap on them with his own hands. I should like to know whether Mr. Luzhinhas any orders of merit; I bet he has the Anna in his buttonhole andthat he puts it on when he goes to dine with contractors or merchants.He will be sure to have it for his wedding, too! Enough of him, confoundhim!
“Well,... mother I don’t wonder at, it’s like her, God bless her, buthow could Dounia? Dounia darling, as though I did not know you! You werenearly twenty when I saw you last: I understood you then. Mother writesthat ‘Dounia can put up with a great deal.’ I know that very well. Iknew that two years and a half ago, and for the last two and a halfyears I have been thinking about it, thinking of just that, that ‘Douniacan put up with a great deal.’ If she could put up with Mr. Svidrigaïlovand all the rest of it, she certainly can put up with a great deal. Andnow mother and she have taken it into their heads that she can put upwith Mr. Luzhin, who propounds the theory of the superiority ofwives raised from destitution and owing everything to their husband’sbounty--who propounds it, too, almost at the first interview. Grantedthat he ‘let it slip,’ though he is a sensible man, (yet maybe itwas not a slip at all, but he meant to make himself clear as soon aspossible) but Dounia, Dounia? She understands the man, of course, butshe will have to live with the man. Why! she’d live on black breadand water, she would not sell her soul, she would not barter her moralfreedom for comfort; she would not barter it for all Schleswig-Holstein,much less Mr. Luzhin’s money. No, Dounia was not that sort when I knewher and... she is still the same, of course! Yes, there’s no denying,the Svidrigaïlovs are a bitter pill! It’s a bitter thing to spend one’slife a governess in the provinces for two hundred roubles, but I knowshe would rather be a nigger on a plantation or a Lett with a Germanmaster than degrade her soul, and her moral dignity, by binding herselffor ever to a man whom she does not respect and with whom she hasnothing in common--for her own advantage. And if Mr. Luzhin had been ofunalloyed gold, or one huge diamond, she would never have consented tobecome his legal concubine. Why is she consenting then? What’s thepoint of it? What’s the answer? It’s clear enough: for herself, for hercomfort, to save her life she would not sell herself, but for someoneelse she is doing it! For one she loves, for one she adores, she willsell herself! That’s what it all amounts to; for her brother, for hermother, she will sell herself! She will sell everything! In such cases,‘we overcome our moral feeling if necessary,’ freedom, peace, conscienceeven, all, all are brought into the market. Let my life go, if only mydear ones may be happy! More than that, we become casuists, we learnto be Jesuitical and for a time maybe we can soothe ourselves, we canpersuade ourselves that it is one’s duty for a good object. That’s justlike us, it’s as clear as daylight. It’s clear that Rodion RomanovitchRaskolnikov is the central figure in the business, and no one else. Oh,yes, she can ensure his happiness, keep him in the university, make hima partner in the office, make his whole future secure; perhaps he mayeven be a rich man later on, prosperous, respected, and may even end hislife a famous man! But my mother? It’s all Rodya, precious Rodya, herfirst born! For such a son who would not sacrifice such a daughter! Oh,loving, over-partial hearts! Why, for his sake we would not shrink evenfrom Sonia’s fate. Sonia, Sonia Marmeladov, the eternal victim so longas the world lasts. Have you taken the measure of your sacrifice, bothof you? Is it right? Can you bear it? Is it any use? Is there sense init? And let me tell you, Dounia, Sonia’s life is no worse than life withMr. Luzhin. ‘There can be no question of love,’ mother writes. And whatif there can be no respect either, if on the contrary there is aversion,contempt, repulsion, what then? So you will have to ‘keep up yourappearance,’ too. Is not that so? Do you understand what that smartnessmeans? Do you understand that the Luzhin smartness is just the samething as Sonia’s and may be worse, viler, baser, because in your case,Dounia, it’s a bargain for luxuries, after all, but with Sonia it’ssimply a question of starvation. It has to be paid for, it has to bepaid for, Dounia, this smartness. And what if it’s more than you canbear afterwards, if you regret it? The bitterness, the misery, thecurses, the tears hidden from all the world, for you are not a MarfaPetrovna. And how will your mother feel then? Even now she is uneasy,she is worried, but then, when she sees it all clearly? And I? Yes,indeed, what have you taken me for? I won’t have your sacrifice, Dounia,I won’t have it, mother! It shall not be, so long as I am alive, itshall not, it shall not! I won’t accept it!”
He suddenly paused in his reflection and stood still.
“It shall not be? But what are you going to do to prevent it? You’llforbid it? And what right have you? What can you promise them on yourside to give you such a right? Your whole life, your whole future, youwill devote to them _when you have finished your studies and obtained apost_? Yes, we have heard all that before, and that’s all _words_, butnow? Now something must be done, now, do you understand that? Andwhat are you doing now? You are living upon them. They borrow on theirhundred roubles pension. They borrow from the Svidrigaïlovs. How areyou going to save them from Svidrigaïlovs, from Afanasy IvanovitchVahrushin, oh, future millionaire Zeus who would arrange their lives forthem? In another ten years? In another ten years, mother will be blindwith knitting shawls, maybe with weeping too. She will be worn to ashadow with fasting; and my sister? Imagine for a moment what may havebecome of your sister in ten years? What may happen to her during thoseten years? Can you fancy?”
So he tortured himself, fretting himself with such questions, andfinding a kind of enjoyment in it. And yet all these questions were notnew ones suddenly confronting him, they were old familiar aches. It waslong since they had first begun to grip and rend his heart. Long, longago his present anguish had its first beginnings; it had waxed andgathered strength, it had matured and concentrated, until it had takenthe form of a fearful, frenzied and fantastic question, which torturedhis heart and mind, clamouring insistently for an answer. Now hismother’s letter had burst on him like a thunderclap. It was clearthat he must not now suffer passively, worrying himself over unsolvedquestions, but that he must do something, do it at once, and do itquickly. Anyway he must decide on something, or else...
“Or throw up life altogether!” he cried suddenly, in a frenzy--“acceptone’s lot humbly as it is, once for all and stifle everything inoneself, giving up all claim to activity, life and love!”
“Do you understand, sir, do you understand what it means when you haveabsolutely nowhere to turn?” Marmeladov’s question came suddenly intohis mind, “for every man must have somewhere to turn....”
He gave a sudden start; another thought, that he had had yesterday,slipped back into his mind. But he did not start at the thoughtrecurring to him, for he knew, he had _felt beforehand_, that it mustcome back, he was expecting it; besides it was not only yesterday’sthought. The difference was that a month ago, yesterday even, thethought was a mere dream: but now... now it appeared not a dream at all,it had taken a new menacing and quite unfamiliar shape, and he suddenlybecame aware of this himself.... He felt a hammering in his head, andthere was a darkness before his eyes.
He looked round hurriedly, he was searching for something. He wantedto sit down and was looking for a seat; he was walking along the K----Boulevard. There was a seat about a hundred paces in front of him. Hewalked towards it as fast he could; but on the way he met with a littleadventure which absorbed all his attention. Looking for the seat, he hadnoticed a woman walking some twenty paces in front of him, but at firsthe took no more notice of her than of other objects that crossed hispath. It had happened to him many times going home not to notice theroad by which he was going, and he was accustomed to walk like that. Butthere was at first sight something so strange about the woman in frontof him, that gradually his attention was riveted upon her, at firstreluctantly and, as it were, resentfully, and then more and moreintently. He felt a sudden desire to find out what it was that was sostrange about the woman. In the first place, she appeared to be a girlquite young, and she was walking in the great heat bareheaded and withno parasol or gloves, waving her arms about in an absurd way. She hadon a dress of some light silky material, but put on strangely awry, notproperly hooked up, and torn open at the top of the skirt, close to thewaist: a great piece was rent and hanging loose. A little kerchief wasflung about her bare throat, but lay slanting on one side. The girl waswalking unsteadily, too, stumbling and staggering from side to side. Shedrew Raskolnikov’s whole attention at last. He overtook the girl at theseat, but, on reaching it, she dropped down on it, in the corner;she let her head sink on the back of the seat and closed her eyes,apparently in extreme exhaustion. Looking at her closely, he saw at oncethat she was completely drunk. It was a strange and shocking sight. Hecould hardly believe that he was not mistaken. He saw before him theface of a quite young, fair-haired girl--sixteen, perhaps not more thanfifteen, years old, pretty little face, but flushed and heavy lookingand, as it were, swollen. The girl seemed hardly to know what she wasdoing; she crossed one leg over the other, lifting it indecorously, andshowed every sign of being unconscious that she was in the street.
Raskolnikov did not sit down, but he felt unwilling to leave her,and stood facing her in perplexity. This boulevard was never muchfrequented; and now, at two o’clock, in the stifling heat, it was quitedeserted. And yet on the further side of the boulevard, about fifteenpaces away, a gentleman was standing on the edge of the pavement. He,too, would apparently have liked to approach the girl with some objectof his own. He, too, had probably seen her in the distance and hadfollowed her, but found Raskolnikov in his way. He looked angrily athim, though he tried to escape his notice, and stood impatiently bidinghis time, till the unwelcome man in rags should have moved away. Hisintentions were unmistakable. The gentleman was a plump, thickly-setman, about thirty, fashionably dressed, with a high colour, red lips andmoustaches. Raskolnikov felt furious; he had a sudden longing to insultthis fat dandy in some way. He left the girl for a moment and walkedtowards the gentleman.
“Hey! You Svidrigaïlov! What do you want here?” he shouted, clenchinghis fists and laughing, spluttering with rage.
“What do you mean?” the gentleman asked sternly, scowling in haughtyastonishment.
“Get away, that’s what I mean.”
“How dare you, you low fellow!”
He raised his cane. Raskolnikov rushed at him with his fists, withoutreflecting that the stout gentleman was a match for two men likehimself. But at that instant someone seized him from behind, and apolice constable stood between them.
“That’s enough, gentlemen, no fighting, please, in a public place. Whatdo you want? Who are you?” he asked Raskolnikov sternly, noticing hisrags.
Raskolnikov looked at him intently. He had a straight-forward, sensible,soldierly face, with grey moustaches and whiskers.
“You are just the man I want,” Raskolnikov cried, catching at his arm.“I am a student, Raskolnikov.... You may as well know that too,” headded, addressing the gentleman, “come along, I have something to showyou.”
And taking the policeman by the hand he drew him towards the seat.
“Look here, hopelessly drunk, and she has just come down the boulevard.There is no telling who and what she is, she does not look like aprofessional. It’s more likely she has been given drink and deceivedsomewhere... for the first time... you understand? and they’ve put herout into the street like that. Look at the way her dress is torn, andthe way it has been put on: she has been dressed by somebody, she hasnot dressed herself, and dressed by unpractised hands, by a man’s hands;that’s evident. And now look there: I don’t know that dandy with whom Iwas going to fight, I see him for the first time, but he, too, has seenher on the road, just now, drunk, not knowing what she is doing, and nowhe is very eager to get hold of her, to get her away somewhere while sheis in this state... that’s certain, believe me, I am not wrong. I sawhim myself watching her and following her, but I prevented him, and heis just waiting for me to go away. Now he has walked away a little, andis standing still, pretending to make a cigarette.... Think how can wekeep her out of his hands, and how are we to get her home?”
The policeman saw it all in a flash. The stout gentleman was easy tounderstand, he turned to consider the girl. The policeman bent over toexamine her more closely, and his face worked with genuine compassion.
“Ah, what a pity!” he said, shaking his head--“why, she is quite achild! She has been deceived, you can see that at once. Listen, lady,”he began addressing her, “where do you live?” The girl opened her wearyand sleepy-looking eyes, gazed blankly at the speaker and waved herhand.
“Here,” said Raskolnikov feeling in his pocket and finding twentycopecks, “here, call a cab and tell him to drive her to her address. Theonly thing is to find out her address!”
“Missy, missy!” the policeman began again, taking the money. “I’ll fetchyou a cab and take you home myself. Where shall I take you, eh? Where doyou live?”
“Go away! They won’t let me alone,” the girl muttered, and once morewaved her hand.
“Ach, ach, how shocking! It’s shameful, missy, it’s a shame!” He shookhis head again, shocked, sympathetic and indignant.
“It’s a difficult job,” the policeman said to Raskolnikov, and as hedid so, he looked him up and down in a rapid glance. He, too, must haveseemed a strange figure to him: dressed in rags and handing him money!
“Did you meet her far from here?” he asked him.
“I tell you she was walking in front of me, staggering, just here, inthe boulevard. She only just reached the seat and sank down on it.”
“Ah, the shameful things that are done in the world nowadays, God havemercy on us! An innocent creature like that, drunk already! She has beendeceived, that’s a sure thing. See how her dress has been torn too....Ah, the vice one sees nowadays! And as likely as not she belongs togentlefolk too, poor ones maybe.... There are many like that nowadays.She looks refined, too, as though she were a lady,” and he bent over heronce more.
Perhaps he had daughters growing up like that, “looking like ladies andrefined” with pretensions to gentility and smartness....
“The chief thing is,” Raskolnikov persisted, “to keep her out of thisscoundrel’s hands! Why should he outrage her! It’s as clear as day whathe is after; ah, the brute, he is not moving off!”
Raskolnikov spoke aloud and pointed to him. The gentleman heard him,and seemed about to fly into a rage again, but thought better of it, andconfined himself to a contemptuous look. He then walked slowly anotherten paces away and again halted.
“Keep her out of his hands we can,” said the constable thoughtfully,“if only she’d tell us where to take her, but as it is.... Missy, hey,missy!” he bent over her once more.
She opened her eyes fully all of a sudden, looked at him intently, asthough realising something, got up from the seat and walked away in thedirection from which she had come. “Oh shameful wretches, they won’t letme alone!” she said, waving her hand again. She walked quickly, thoughstaggering as before. The dandy followed her, but along another avenue,keeping his eye on her.
“Don’t be anxious, I won’t let him have her,” the policeman saidresolutely, and he set off after them.
“Ah, the vice one sees nowadays!” he repeated aloud, sighing.
At that moment something seemed to sting Raskolnikov; in an instant acomplete revulsion of feeling came over him.
“Hey, here!” he shouted after the policeman.
The latter turned round.
“Let them be! What is it to do with you? Let her go! Let him amusehimself.” He pointed at the dandy, “What is it to do with you?”
The policeman was bewildered, and stared at him open-eyed. Raskolnikovlaughed.
“Well!” ejaculated the policeman, with a gesture of contempt, and hewalked after the dandy and the girl, probably taking Raskolnikov for amadman or something even worse.
“He has carried off my twenty copecks,” Raskolnikov murmured angrilywhen he was left alone. “Well, let him take as much from the otherfellow to allow him to have the girl and so let it end. And why did Iwant to interfere? Is it for me to help? Have I any right to help? Letthem devour each other alive--what is it to me? How did I dare to give himtwenty copecks? Were they mine?”
In spite of those strange words he felt very wretched. He sat down onthe deserted seat. His thoughts strayed aimlessly.... He found it hardto fix his mind on anything at that moment. He longed to forget himselfaltogether, to forget everything, and then to wake up and begin lifeanew....
“Poor girl!” he said, looking at the empty corner where she hadsat--“She will come to herself and weep, and then her mother will findout.... She will give her a beating, a horrible, shameful beating andthen maybe, turn her out of doors.... And even if she does not, theDarya Frantsovnas will get wind of it, and the girl will soon beslipping out on the sly here and there. Then there will be the hospitaldirectly (that’s always the luck of those girls with respectablemothers, who go wrong on the sly) and then... again the hospital...drink... the taverns... and more hospital, in two or three years--awreck, and her life over at eighteen or nineteen.... Have not I seencases like that? And how have they been brought to it? Why, they’ve allcome to it like that. Ugh! But what does it matter? That’s as it shouldbe, they tell us. A certain percentage, they tell us, must every yeargo... that way... to the devil, I suppose, so that the rest may remainchaste, and not be interfered with. A percentage! What splendid wordsthey have; they are so scientific, so consolatory.... Once you’ve said‘percentage’ there’s nothing more to worry about. If we had any otherword... maybe we might feel more uneasy.... But what if Dounia were oneof the percentage! Of another one if not that one?
“But where am I going?” he thought suddenly. “Strange, I came out forsomething. As soon as I had read the letter I came out.... I was goingto Vassilyevsky Ostrov, to Razumihin. That’s what it was... now Iremember. What for, though? And what put the idea of going to Razumihininto my head just now? That’s curious.”
He wondered at himself. Razumihin was one of his old comrades at theuniversity. It was remarkable that Raskolnikov had hardly any friends atthe university; he kept aloof from everyone, went to see no one, and didnot welcome anyone who came to see him, and indeed everyone soon gavehim up. He took no part in the students’ gatherings, amusements orconversations. He worked with great intensity without sparing himself,and he was respected for this, but no one liked him. He was very poor,and there was a sort of haughty pride and reserve about him, as thoughhe were keeping something to himself. He seemed to some of his comradesto look down upon them all as children, as though he were superior indevelopment, knowledge and convictions, as though their beliefs andinterests were beneath him.
With Razumihin he had got on, or, at least, he was more unreserved andcommunicative with him. Indeed it was impossible to be on any otherterms with Razumihin. He was an exceptionally good-humoured and candidyouth, good-natured to the point of simplicity, though both depth anddignity lay concealed under that simplicity. The better of his comradesunderstood this, and all were fond of him. He was extremely intelligent,though he was certainly rather a simpleton at times. He was of strikingappearance--tall, thin, blackhaired and always badly shaved. He wassometimes uproarious and was reputed to be of great physical strength.One night, when out in a festive company, he had with one blow laida gigantic policeman on his back. There was no limit to his drinkingpowers, but he could abstain from drink altogether; he sometimes wenttoo far in his pranks; but he could do without pranks altogether.Another thing striking about Razumihin, no failure distressed him, andit seemed as though no unfavourable circumstances could crush him. Hecould lodge anywhere, and bear the extremes of cold and hunger. He wasvery poor, and kept himself entirely on what he could earn by work ofone sort or another. He knew of no end of resources by which to earnmoney. He spent one whole winter without lighting his stove, and used todeclare that he liked it better, because one slept more soundly inthe cold. For the present he, too, had been obliged to give up theuniversity, but it was only for a time, and he was working with all hismight to save enough to return to his studies again. Raskolnikov hadnot been to see him for the last four months, and Razumihin did not evenknow his address. About two months before, they had met in the street,but Raskolnikov had turned away and even crossed to the other side thathe might not be observed. And though Razumihin noticed him, he passedhim by, as he did not want to annoy him.
CHAPTER V
“Of course, I’ve been meaning lately to go to Razumihin’s to ask forwork, to ask him to get me lessons or something...” Raskolnikov thought,“but what help can he be to me now? Suppose he gets me lessons, supposehe shares his last farthing with me, if he has any farthings, so thatI could get some boots and make myself tidy enough to give lessons...hm... Well and what then? What shall I do with the few coppers Iearn? That’s not what I want now. It’s really absurd for me to go toRazumihin....”
The question why he was now going to Razumihin agitated him even morethan he was himself aware; he kept uneasily seeking for some sinistersignificance in this apparently ordinary action.
“Could I have expected to set it all straight and to find a way out bymeans of Razumihin alone?” he asked himself in perplexity.
He pondered and rubbed his forehead, and, strange to say, after longmusing, suddenly, as if it were spontaneously and by chance, a fantasticthought came into his head.
“Hm... to Razumihin’s,” he said all at once, calmly, as though he hadreached a final determination. “I shall go to Razumihin’s of course,but... not now. I shall go to him... on the next day after It, when Itwill be over and everything will begin afresh....”
And suddenly he realised what he was thinking.
“After It,” he shouted, jumping up from the seat, “but is It reallygoing to happen? Is it possible it really will happen?” He left theseat, and went off almost at a run; he meant to turn back, homewards,but the thought of going home suddenly filled him with intense loathing;in that hole, in that awful little cupboard of his, all _this_ had for amonth past been growing up in him; and he walked on at random.
His nervous shudder had passed into a fever that made him feelshivering; in spite of the heat he felt cold. With a kind of effort hebegan almost unconsciously, from some inner craving, to stare at allthe objects before him, as though looking for something to distract hisattention; but he did not succeed, and kept dropping every moment intobrooding. When with a start he lifted his head again and looked round,he forgot at once what he had just been thinking about and even where hewas going. In this way he walked right across Vassilyevsky Ostrov, cameout on to the Lesser Neva, crossed the bridge and turned towards theislands. The greenness and freshness were at first restful to his wearyeyes after the dust of the town and the huge houses that hemmed him inand weighed upon him. Here there were no taverns, no stifling closeness,no stench. But soon these new pleasant sensations passed into morbidirritability. Sometimes he stood still before a brightly painted summervilla standing among green foliage, he gazed through the fence, he sawin the distance smartly dressed women on the verandahs and balconies,and children running in the gardens. The flowers especially caught hisattention; he gazed at them longer than at anything. He was met, too, byluxurious carriages and by men and women on horseback; he watched themwith curious eyes and forgot about them before they had vanished fromhis sight. Once he stood still and counted his money; he found he hadthirty copecks. “Twenty to the policeman, three to Nastasya for theletter, so I must have given forty-seven or fifty to the Marmeladovsyesterday,” he thought, reckoning it up for some unknown reason, but hesoon forgot with what object he had taken the money out of his pocket.He recalled it on passing an eating-house or tavern, and felt that hewas hungry.... Going into the tavern he drank a glass of vodka and ate apie of some sort. He finished eating it as he walked away. It was a longwhile since he had taken vodka and it had an effect upon him at once,though he only drank a wineglassful. His legs felt suddenly heavy anda great drowsiness came upon him. He turned homewards, but reachingPetrovsky Ostrov he stopped completely exhausted, turned off the roadinto the bushes, sank down upon the grass and instantly fell asleep.
In a morbid condition of the brain, dreams often have a singularactuality, vividness, and extraordinary semblance of reality. At timesmonstrous images are created, but the setting and the whole picture areso truth-like and filled with details so delicate, so unexpectedly, butso artistically consistent, that the dreamer, were he an artist likePushkin or Turgenev even, could never have invented them in the wakingstate. Such sick dreams always remain long in the memory and make apowerful impression on the overwrought and deranged nervous system.
Raskolnikov had a fearful dream. He dreamt he was back in his childhoodin the little town of his birth. He was a child about seven years old,walking into the country with his father on the evening of a holiday. Itwas a grey and heavy day, the country was exactly as he remembered it;indeed he recalled it far more vividly in his dream than he had done inmemory. The little town stood on a level flat as bare as the hand, noteven a willow near it; only in the far distance, a copse lay, a darkblur on the very edge of the horizon. A few paces beyond the last marketgarden stood a tavern, a big tavern, which had always aroused in him afeeling of aversion, even of fear, when he walked by it with his father.There was always a crowd there, always shouting, laughter and abuse,hideous hoarse singing and often fighting. Drunken and horrible-lookingfigures were hanging about the tavern. He used to cling close to hisfather, trembling all over when he met them. Near the tavern the roadbecame a dusty track, the dust of which was always black. It was awinding road, and about a hundred paces further on, it turned to theright to the graveyard. In the middle of the graveyard stood a stonechurch with a green cupola where he used to go to mass two or threetimes a year with his father and mother, when a service was held inmemory of his grandmother, who had long been dead, and whom he had neverseen. On these occasions they used to take on a white dish tied up in atable napkin a special sort of rice pudding with raisins stuck in it inthe shape of a cross. He loved that church, the old-fashioned, unadornedikons and the old priest with the shaking head. Near his grandmother’sgrave, which was marked by a stone, was the little grave of his youngerbrother who had died at six months old. He did not remember him at all,but he had been told about his little brother, and whenever he visitedthe graveyard he used religiously and reverently to cross himself andto bow down and kiss the little grave. And now he dreamt that he waswalking with his father past the tavern on the way to the graveyard; hewas holding his father’s hand and looking with dread at the tavern. Apeculiar circumstance attracted his attention: there seemed to besome kind of festivity going on, there were crowds of gaily dressedtownspeople, peasant women, their husbands, and riff-raff of all sorts,all singing and all more or less drunk. Near the entrance of the tavernstood a cart, but a strange cart. It was one of those big carts usuallydrawn by heavy cart-horses and laden with casks of wine or other heavygoods. He always liked looking at those great cart-horses, with theirlong manes, thick legs, and slow even pace, drawing along a perfectmountain with no appearance of effort, as though it were easier goingwith a load than without it. But now, strange to say, in the shafts ofsuch a cart he saw a thin little sorrel beast, one of those peasants’nags which he had often seen straining their utmost under a heavy loadof wood or hay, especially when the wheels were stuck in the mud or ina rut. And the peasants would beat them so cruelly, sometimes evenabout the nose and eyes, and he felt so sorry, so sorry for them thathe almost cried, and his mother always used to take him away from thewindow. All of a sudden there was a great uproar of shouting, singingand the balalaïka, and from the tavern a number of big and very drunkenpeasants came out, wearing red and blue shirts and coats thrown overtheir shoulders.
“Get in, get in!” shouted one of them, a young thick-necked peasant witha fleshy face red as a carrot. “I’ll take you all, get in!”
But at once there was an outbreak of laughter and exclamations in thecrowd.
“Take us all with a beast like that!”
“Why, Mikolka, are you crazy to put a nag like that in such a cart?”
“And this mare is twenty if she is a day, mates!”
“Get in, I’ll take you all,” Mikolka shouted again, leaping first intothe cart, seizing the reins and standing straight up in front. “The bayhas gone with Matvey,” he shouted from the cart--“and this brute, mates,is just breaking my heart, I feel as if I could kill her. She’s justeating her head off. Get in, I tell you! I’ll make her gallop! She’llgallop!” and he picked up the whip, preparing himself with relish toflog the little mare.
“Get in! Come along!” The crowd laughed. “D’you hear, she’ll gallop!”
“Gallop indeed! She has not had a gallop in her for the last ten years!”
“She’ll jog along!”
“Don’t you mind her, mates, bring a whip each of you, get ready!”
“All right! Give it to her!”
They all clambered into Mikolka’s cart, laughing and making jokes. Sixmen got in and there was still room for more. They hauled in a fat,rosy-cheeked woman. She was dressed in red cotton, in a pointed, beadedheaddress and thick leather shoes; she was cracking nuts and laughing.The crowd round them was laughing too and indeed, how could they helplaughing? That wretched nag was to drag all the cartload of them at agallop! Two young fellows in the cart were just getting whips ready tohelp Mikolka. With the cry of “now,” the mare tugged with all her might,but far from galloping, could scarcely move forward; she struggled withher legs, gasping and shrinking from the blows of the three whips whichwere showered upon her like hail. The laughter in the cart and in thecrowd was redoubled, but Mikolka flew into a rage and furiously thrashedthe mare, as though he supposed she really could gallop.
“Let me get in, too, mates,” shouted a young man in the crowd whoseappetite was aroused.
“Get in, all get in,” cried Mikolka, “she will draw you all. I’ll beather to death!” And he thrashed and thrashed at the mare, beside himselfwith fury.
“Father, father,” he cried, “father, what are they doing? Father, theyare beating the poor horse!”
“Come along, come along!” said his father. “They are drunken andfoolish, they are in fun; come away, don’t look!” and he tried to drawhim away, but he tore himself away from his hand, and, beside himselfwith horror, ran to the horse. The poor beast was in a bad way. She wasgasping, standing still, then tugging again and almost falling.
“Beat her to death,” cried Mikolka, “it’s come to that. I’ll do forher!”
“What are you about, are you a Christian, you devil?” shouted an old manin the crowd.
“Did anyone ever see the like? A wretched nag like that pulling such acartload,” said another.
“You’ll kill her,” shouted the third.
“Don’t meddle! It’s my property, I’ll do what I choose. Get in, more ofyou! Get in, all of you! I will have her go at a gallop!...”
All at once laughter broke into a roar and covered everything: the mare,roused by the shower of blows, began feebly kicking. Even the old mancould not help smiling. To think of a wretched little beast like thattrying to kick!
Two lads in the crowd snatched up whips and ran to the mare to beat herabout the ribs. One ran each side.
“Hit her in the face, in the eyes, in the eyes,” cried Mikolka.
“Give us a song, mates,” shouted someone in the cart and everyone in thecart joined in a riotous song, jingling a tambourine and whistling. Thewoman went on cracking nuts and laughing.
... He ran beside the mare, ran in front of her, saw her being whippedacross the eyes, right in the eyes! He was crying, he felt choking, histears were streaming. One of the men gave him a cut with the whip acrossthe face, he did not feel it. Wringing his hands and screaming, herushed up to the grey-headed old man with the grey beard, who wasshaking his head in disapproval. One woman seized him by the hand andwould have taken him away, but he tore himself from her and ran back tothe mare. She was almost at the last gasp, but began kicking once more.
“I’ll teach you to kick,” Mikolka shouted ferociously. He threw downthe whip, bent forward and picked up from the bottom of the cart a long,thick shaft, he took hold of one end with both hands and with an effortbrandished it over the mare.
“He’ll crush her,” was shouted round him. “He’ll kill her!”
“It’s my property,” shouted Mikolka and brought the shaft down with aswinging blow. There was a sound of a heavy thud.
“Thrash her, thrash her! Why have you stopped?” shouted voices in thecrowd.
And Mikolka swung the shaft a second time and it fell a second timeon the spine of the luckless mare. She sank back on her haunches, butlurched forward and tugged forward with all her force, tugged first onone side and then on the other, trying to move the cart. But the sixwhips were attacking her in all directions, and the shaft was raisedagain and fell upon her a third time, then a fourth, with heavy measuredblows. Mikolka was in a fury that he could not kill her at one blow.
“She’s a tough one,” was shouted in the crowd.
“She’ll fall in a minute, mates, there will soon be an end of her,” saidan admiring spectator in the crowd.
“Fetch an axe to her! Finish her off,” shouted a third.
“I’ll show you! Stand off,” Mikolka screamed frantically; he threw downthe shaft, stooped down in the cart and picked up an iron crowbar. “Lookout,” he shouted, and with all his might he dealt a stunning blow at thepoor mare. The blow fell; the mare staggered, sank back, tried to pull,but the bar fell again with a swinging blow on her back and she fell onthe ground like a log.
“Finish her off,” shouted Mikolka and he leapt beside himself, out ofthe cart. Several young men, also flushed with drink, seized anythingthey could come across--whips, sticks, poles, and ran to the dyingmare. Mikolka stood on one side and began dealing random blows with thecrowbar. The mare stretched out her head, drew a long breath and died.
“You butchered her,” someone shouted in the crowd.
“Why wouldn’t she gallop then?”
“My property!” shouted Mikolka, with bloodshot eyes, brandishing the barin his hands. He stood as though regretting that he had nothing more tobeat.
“No mistake about it, you are not a Christian,” many voices wereshouting in the crowd.
But the poor boy, beside himself, made his way, screaming, through thecrowd to the sorrel nag, put his arms round her bleeding dead head andkissed it, kissed the eyes and kissed the lips.... Then he jumped up andflew in a frenzy with his little fists out at Mikolka. At that instanthis father, who had been running after him, snatched him up and carriedhim out of the crowd.
“Come along, come! Let us go home,” he said to him.
“Father! Why did they... kill... the poor horse!” he sobbed, but hisvoice broke and the words came in shrieks from his panting chest.
“They are drunk.... They are brutal... it’s not our business!” said hisfather. He put his arms round his father but he felt choked, choked. Hetried to draw a breath, to cry out--and woke up.
He waked up, gasping for breath, his hair soaked with perspiration, andstood up in terror.
“Thank God, that was only a dream,” he said, sitting down under a treeand drawing deep breaths. “But what is it? Is it some fever coming on?Such a hideous dream!”
He felt utterly broken: darkness and confusion were in his soul. Herested his elbows on his knees and leaned his head on his hands.
“Good God!” he cried, “can it be, can it be, that I shall really take anaxe, that I shall strike her on the head, split her skull open... that Ishall tread in the sticky warm blood, break the lock, steal and tremble;hide, all spattered in the blood... with the axe.... Good God, can itbe?”
He was shaking like a leaf as he said this.
“But why am I going on like this?” he continued, sitting up again, as itwere in profound amazement. “I knew that I could never bring myselfto it, so what have I been torturing myself for till now? Yesterday,yesterday, when I went to make that... _experiment_, yesterday Irealised completely that I could never bear to do it.... Why am I goingover it again, then? Why am I hesitating? As I came down the stairsyesterday, I said myself that it was base, loathsome, vile, vile... thevery thought of it made me feel sick and filled me with horror.
“No, I couldn’t do it, I couldn’t do it! Granted, granted that there isno flaw in all that reasoning, that all that I have concluded this lastmonth is clear as day, true as arithmetic.... My God! Anyway I couldn’tbring myself to it! I couldn’t do it, I couldn’t do it! Why, why then amI still...?”
He rose to his feet, looked round in wonder as though surprised atfinding himself in this place, and went towards the bridge. He was pale,his eyes glowed, he was exhausted in every limb, but he seemed suddenlyto breathe more easily. He felt he had cast off that fearful burden thathad so long been weighing upon him, and all at once there was a senseof relief and peace in his soul. “Lord,” he prayed, “show me my path--Irenounce that accursed... dream of mine.”
Crossing the bridge, he gazed quietly and calmly at the Neva, at theglowing red sun setting in the glowing sky. In spite of his weakness hewas not conscious of fatigue. It was as though an abscess that had beenforming for a month past in his heart had suddenly broken. Freedom,freedom! He was free from that spell, that sorcery, that obsession!
Later on, when he recalled that time and all that happened to him duringthose days, minute by minute, point by point, he was superstitiouslyimpressed by one circumstance, which, though in itself not veryexceptional, always seemed to him afterwards the predestinedturning-point of his fate. He could never understand and explain tohimself why, when he was tired and worn out, when it would have beenmore convenient for him to go home by the shortest and most direct way,he had returned by the Hay Market where he had no need to go. It wasobviously and quite unnecessarily out of his way, though not much so. Itis true that it happened to him dozens of times to return home withoutnoticing what streets he passed through. But why, he was always askinghimself, why had such an important, such a decisive and at the same timesuch an absolutely chance meeting happened in the Hay Market (where hehad moreover no reason to go) at the very hour, the very minute of hislife when he was just in the very mood and in the very circumstancesin which that meeting was able to exert the gravest and most decisiveinfluence on his whole destiny? As though it had been lying in wait forhim on purpose!
It was about nine o’clock when he crossed the Hay Market. At the tablesand the barrows, at the booths and the shops, all the market people wereclosing their establishments or clearing away and packing up theirwares and, like their customers, were going home. Rag pickers andcostermongers of all kinds were crowding round the taverns in the dirtyand stinking courtyards of the Hay Market. Raskolnikov particularlyliked this place and the neighbouring alleys, when he wandered aimlesslyin the streets. Here his rags did not attract contemptuous attention,and one could walk about in any attire without scandalising people. Atthe corner of an alley a huckster and his wife had two tables set outwith tapes, thread, cotton handkerchiefs, etc. They, too, had got up togo home, but were lingering in conversation with a friend, who had justcome up to them. This friend was Lizaveta Ivanovna, or, as everyonecalled her, Lizaveta, the younger sister of the old pawnbroker, AlyonaIvanovna, whom Raskolnikov had visited the previous day to pawn hiswatch and make his _experiment_.... He already knew all about Lizavetaand she knew him a little too. She was a single woman of aboutthirty-five, tall, clumsy, timid, submissive and almost idiotic. She wasa complete slave and went in fear and trembling of her sister, whomade her work day and night, and even beat her. She was standing witha bundle before the huckster and his wife, listening earnestly anddoubtfully. They were talking of something with special warmth. Themoment Raskolnikov caught sight of her, he was overcome by a strangesensation as it were of intense astonishment, though there was nothingastonishing about this meeting.
“You could make up your mind for yourself, Lizaveta Ivanovna,” thehuckster was saying aloud. “Come round to-morrow about seven. They willbe here too.”
“To-morrow?” said Lizaveta slowly and thoughtfully, as though unable tomake up her mind.
“Upon my word, what a fright you are in of Alyona Ivanovna,” gabbledthe huckster’s wife, a lively little woman. “I look at you, you are likesome little babe. And she is not your own sister either--nothing but astep-sister and what a hand she keeps over you!”
“But this time don’t say a word to Alyona Ivanovna,” her husbandinterrupted; “that’s my advice, but come round to us without asking.It will be worth your while. Later on your sister herself may have anotion.”
“Am I to come?”
“About seven o’clock to-morrow. And they will be here. You will be ableto decide for yourself.”
“And we’ll have a cup of tea,” added his wife.
“All right, I’ll come,” said Lizaveta, still pondering, and she beganslowly moving away.
Raskolnikov had just passed and heard no more. He passed softly,unnoticed, trying not to miss a word. His first amazement was followedby a thrill of horror, like a shiver running down his spine. He hadlearnt, he had suddenly quite unexpectedly learnt, that the next day atseven o’clock Lizaveta, the old woman’s sister and only companion, wouldbe away from home and that therefore at seven o’clock precisely the oldwoman _would be left alone_.
He was only a few steps from his lodging. He went in like a mancondemned to death. He thought of nothing and was incapable of thinking;but he felt suddenly in his whole being that he had no more freedomof thought, no will, and that everything was suddenly and irrevocablydecided.
Certainly, if he had to wait whole years for a suitable opportunity, hecould not reckon on a more certain step towards the success of the planthan that which had just presented itself. In any case, it would havebeen difficult to find out beforehand and with certainty, withgreater exactness and less risk, and without dangerous inquiries andinvestigations, that next day at a certain time an old woman, on whoselife an attempt was contemplated, would be at home and entirely alone.
CHAPTER VI
Later on Raskolnikov happened to find out why the huckster and hiswife had invited Lizaveta. It was a very ordinary matter and there wasnothing exceptional about it. A family who had come to the town and beenreduced to poverty were selling their household goods and clothes, allwomen’s things. As the things would have fetched little in the market,they were looking for a dealer. This was Lizaveta’s business. Sheundertook such jobs and was frequently employed, as she was very honestand always fixed a fair price and stuck to it. She spoke as a rulelittle and, as we have said already, she was very submissive and timid.
But Raskolnikov had become superstitious of late. The traces ofsuperstition remained in him long after, and were almost ineradicable.And in all this he was always afterwards disposed to see somethingstrange and mysterious, as it were, the presence of some peculiarinfluences and coincidences. In the previous winter a student he knewcalled Pokorev, who had left for Harkov, had chanced in conversation togive him the address of Alyona Ivanovna, the old pawnbroker, in case hemight want to pawn anything. For a long while he did not go to her, forhe had lessons and managed to get along somehow. Six weeks ago he hadremembered the address; he had two articles that could be pawned: hisfather’s old silver watch and a little gold ring with three red stones,a present from his sister at parting. He decided to take the ring. Whenhe found the old woman he had felt an insurmountable repulsion for herat the first glance, though he knew nothing special about her. He gottwo roubles from her and went into a miserable little tavern on his wayhome. He asked for tea, sat down and sank into deep thought. A strangeidea was pecking at his brain like a chicken in the egg, and very, verymuch absorbed him.
Almost beside him at the next table there was sitting a student, whom hedid not know and had never seen, and with him a young officer. They hadplayed a game of billiards and began drinking tea. All at once he heardthe student mention to the officer the pawnbroker Alyona Ivanovna andgive him her address. This of itself seemed strange to Raskolnikov; hehad just come from her and here at once he heard her name. Of courseit was a chance, but he could not shake off a very extraordinaryimpression, and here someone seemed to be speaking expressly for him;the student began telling his friend various details about AlyonaIvanovna.
“She is first-rate,” he said. “You can always get money from her. She isas rich as a Jew, she can give you five thousand roubles at a time andshe is not above taking a pledge for a rouble. Lots of our fellows havehad dealings with her. But she is an awful old harpy....”
And he began describing how spiteful and uncertain she was, how if youwere only a day late with your interest the pledge was lost; how shegave a quarter of the value of an article and took five and even sevenpercent a month on it and so on. The student chattered on, sayingthat she had a sister Lizaveta, whom the wretched little creature wascontinually beating, and kept in complete bondage like a small child,though Lizaveta was at least six feet high.
“There’s a phenomenon for you,” cried the student and he laughed.
They began talking about Lizaveta. The student spoke about her with apeculiar relish and was continually laughing and the officer listenedwith great interest and asked him to send Lizaveta to do some mendingfor him. Raskolnikov did not miss a word and learned everything abouther. Lizaveta was younger than the old woman and was her half-sister,being the child of a different mother. She was thirty-five. She workedday and night for her sister, and besides doing the cooking and thewashing, she did sewing and worked as a charwoman and gave her sisterall she earned. She did not dare to accept an order or job of any kindwithout her sister’s permission. The old woman had already made herwill, and Lizaveta knew of it, and by this will she would not get afarthing; nothing but the movables, chairs and so on; all the money wasleft to a monastery in the province of N----, that prayers might besaid for her in perpetuity. Lizaveta was of lower rank than her sister,unmarried and awfully uncouth in appearance, remarkably tall with longfeet that looked as if they were bent outwards. She always wore batteredgoatskin shoes, and was clean in her person. What the student expressedmost surprise and amusement about was the fact that Lizaveta wascontinually with child.
“But you say she is hideous?” observed the officer.
“Yes, she is so dark-skinned and looks like a soldier dressed up, butyou know she is not at all hideous. She has such a good-natured faceand eyes. Strikingly so. And the proof of it is that lots of people areattracted by her. She is such a soft, gentle creature, ready to put upwith anything, always willing, willing to do anything. And her smile isreally very sweet.”
“You seem to find her attractive yourself,” laughed the officer.
“From her queerness. No, I’ll tell you what. I could kill that damnedold woman and make off with her money, I assure you, without thefaintest conscience-prick,” the student added with warmth. The officerlaughed again while Raskolnikov shuddered. How strange it was!
“Listen, I want to ask you a serious question,” the student said hotly.“I was joking of course, but look here; on one side we have a stupid,senseless, worthless, spiteful, ailing, horrid old woman, not simplyuseless but doing actual mischief, who has not an idea what she isliving for herself, and who will die in a day or two in any case. Youunderstand? You understand?”
“Yes, yes, I understand,” answered the officer, watching his excitedcompanion attentively.
“Well, listen then. On the other side, fresh young lives thrown away forwant of help and by thousands, on every side! A hundred thousand gooddeeds could be done and helped, on that old woman’s money which will beburied in a monastery! Hundreds, thousands perhaps, might be set on theright path; dozens of families saved from destitution, from ruin, fromvice, from the Lock hospitals--and all with her money. Kill her, takeher money and with the help of it devote oneself to the service ofhumanity and the good of all. What do you think, would not one tinycrime be wiped out by thousands of good deeds? For one life thousandswould be saved from corruption and decay. One death, and a hundred livesin exchange--it’s simple arithmetic! Besides, what value has the life ofthat sickly, stupid, ill-natured old woman in the balance of existence!No more than the life of a louse, of a black-beetle, less in factbecause the old woman is doing harm. She is wearing out the lives ofothers; the other day she bit Lizaveta’s finger out of spite; it almosthad to be amputated.”
“Of course she does not deserve to live,” remarked the officer, “butthere it is, it’s nature.”
“Oh, well, brother, but we have to correct and direct nature, and, butfor that, we should drown in an ocean of prejudice. But for that,there would never have been a single great man. They talk ofduty, conscience--I don’t want to say anything against duty andconscience;--but the point is, what do we mean by them? Stay, I haveanother question to ask you. Listen!”
“No, you stay, I’ll ask you a question. Listen!”
“Well?”
“You are talking and speechifying away, but tell me, would you kill theold woman _yourself_?”
“Of course not! I was only arguing the justice of it.... It’s nothing todo with me....”
“But I think, if you would not do it yourself, there’s no justice aboutit.... Let us have another game.”
Raskolnikov was violently agitated. Of course, it was all ordinaryyouthful talk and thought, such as he had often heard before indifferent forms and on different themes. But why had he happened to hearsuch a discussion and such ideas at the very moment when his own brainwas just conceiving... _the very same ideas_? And why, just at themoment when he had brought away the embryo of his idea from the oldwoman had he dropped at once upon a conversation about her? Thiscoincidence always seemed strange to him. This trivial talk in a tavernhad an immense influence on him in his later action; as though there hadreally been in it something preordained, some guiding hint....
*****
On returning from the Hay Market he flung himself on the sofa and satfor a whole hour without stirring. Meanwhile it got dark; he had nocandle and, indeed, it did not occur to him to light up. He could neverrecollect whether he had been thinking about anything at that time. Atlast he was conscious of his former fever and shivering, and he realisedwith relief that he could lie down on the sofa. Soon heavy, leaden sleepcame over him, as it were crushing him.
He slept an extraordinarily long time and without dreaming. Nastasya,coming into his room at ten o’clock the next morning, had difficultyin rousing him. She brought him in tea and bread. The tea was again thesecond brew and again in her own tea-pot.
“My goodness, how he sleeps!” she cried indignantly. “And he is alwaysasleep.”
He got up with an effort. His head ached, he stood up, took a turn inhis garret and sank back on the sofa again.
“Going to sleep again,” cried Nastasya. “Are you ill, eh?”
He made no reply.
“Do you want some tea?”
“Afterwards,” he said with an effort, closing his eyes again and turningto the wall.
Nastasya stood over him.
“Perhaps he really is ill,” she said, turned and went out. She came inagain at two o’clock with soup. He was lying as before. The tea stooduntouched. Nastasya felt positively offended and began wrathfullyrousing him.
“Why are you lying like a log?” she shouted, looking at him withrepulsion.
He got up, and sat down again, but said nothing and stared at the floor.
“Are you ill or not?” asked Nastasya and again received no answer.“You’d better go out and get a breath of air,” she said after a pause.“Will you eat it or not?”
“Afterwards,” he said weakly. “You can go.”
And he motioned her out.
She remained a little longer, looked at him with compassion and wentout.
A few minutes afterwards, he raised his eyes and looked for a long whileat the tea and the soup. Then he took the bread, took up a spoon andbegan to eat.
He ate a little, three or four spoonfuls, without appetite, as it weremechanically. His head ached less. After his meal he stretched himselfon the sofa again, but now he could not sleep; he lay without stirring,with his face in the pillow. He was haunted by day-dreams and suchstrange day-dreams; in one, that kept recurring, he fancied that he wasin Africa, in Egypt, in some sort of oasis. The caravan was resting,the camels were peacefully lying down; the palms stood all around in acomplete circle; all the party were at dinner. But he was drinking waterfrom a spring which flowed gurgling close by. And it was so cool, it waswonderful, wonderful, blue, cold water running among the parti-colouredstones and over the clean sand which glistened here and there likegold.... Suddenly he heard a clock strike. He started, roused himself,raised his head, looked out of the window, and seeing how late it was,suddenly jumped up wide awake as though someone had pulled him off thesofa. He crept on tiptoe to the door, stealthily opened it and beganlistening on the staircase. His heart beat terribly. But all was quieton the stairs as if everyone was asleep.... It seemed to him strange andmonstrous that he could have slept in such forgetfulness from theprevious day and had done nothing, had prepared nothing yet.... Andmeanwhile perhaps it had struck six. And his drowsiness and stupefactionwere followed by an extraordinary, feverish, as it were distractedhaste. But the preparations to be made were few. He concentrated all hisenergies on thinking of everything and forgetting nothing; and his heartkept beating and thumping so that he could hardly breathe. First he hadto make a noose and sew it into his overcoat--a work of a moment. Herummaged under his pillow and picked out amongst the linen stuffed awayunder it, a worn out, old unwashed shirt. From its rags he tore a longstrip, a couple of inches wide and about sixteen inches long. He foldedthis strip in two, took off his wide, strong summer overcoat of somestout cotton material (his only outer garment) and began sewing the twoends of the rag on the inside, under the left armhole. His hands shookas he sewed, but he did it successfully so that nothing showed outsidewhen he put the coat on again. The needle and thread he had got readylong before and they lay on his table in a piece of paper. As for thenoose, it was a very ingenious device of his own; the noose was intendedfor the axe. It was impossible for him to carry the axe through thestreet in his hands. And if hidden under his coat he would still havehad to support it with his hand, which would have been noticeable. Nowhe had only to put the head of the axe in the noose, and it would hangquietly under his arm on the inside. Putting his hand in his coatpocket, he could hold the end of the handle all the way, so that it didnot swing; and as the coat was very full, a regular sack in fact, itcould not be seen from outside that he was holding something with thehand that was in the pocket. This noose, too, he had designed afortnight before.
When he had finished with this, he thrust his hand into a little openingbetween his sofa and the floor, fumbled in the left corner and drew outthe _pledge_, which he had got ready long before and hidden there. Thispledge was, however, only a smoothly planed piece of wood the size andthickness of a silver cigarette case. He picked up this piece of woodin one of his wanderings in a courtyard where there was some sort ofa workshop. Afterwards he had added to the wood a thin smooth pieceof iron, which he had also picked up at the same time in the street.Putting the iron which was a little the smaller on the piece of wood,he fastened them very firmly, crossing and re-crossing the thread roundthem; then wrapped them carefully and daintily in clean white paper andtied up the parcel so that it would be very difficult to untie it. Thiswas in order to divert the attention of the old woman for a time, whileshe was trying to undo the knot, and so to gain a moment. The iron stripwas added to give weight, so that the woman might not guess the firstminute that the “thing” was made of wood. All this had been stored byhim beforehand under the sofa. He had only just got the pledge out whenhe heard someone suddenly about in the yard.
“It struck six long ago.”
“Long ago! My God!”
He rushed to the door, listened, caught up his hat and began to descendhis thirteen steps cautiously, noiselessly, like a cat. He had still themost important thing to do--to steal the axe from the kitchen. That thedeed must be done with an axe he had decided long ago. He had also apocket pruning-knife, but he could not rely on the knife and still lesson his own strength, and so resolved finally on the axe. We may note inpassing, one peculiarity in regard to all the final resolutions taken byhim in the matter; they had one strange characteristic: the more finalthey were, the more hideous and the more absurd they at once became inhis eyes. In spite of all his agonising inward struggle, he never fora single instant all that time could believe in the carrying out of hisplans.
And, indeed, if it had ever happened that everything to the least pointcould have been considered and finally settled, and no uncertainty ofany kind had remained, he would, it seems, have renounced it allas something absurd, monstrous and impossible. But a whole mass ofunsettled points and uncertainties remained. As for getting the axe,that trifling business cost him no anxiety, for nothing could be easier.Nastasya was continually out of the house, especially in the evenings;she would run in to the neighbours or to a shop, and always left thedoor ajar. It was the one thing the landlady was always scolding herabout. And so, when the time came, he would only have to go quietly intothe kitchen and to take the axe, and an hour later (when everythingwas over) go in and put it back again. But these were doubtful points.Supposing he returned an hour later to put it back, and Nastasya hadcome back and was on the spot. He would of course have to go by and waittill she went out again. But supposing she were in the meantime to missthe axe, look for it, make an outcry--that would mean suspicion or atleast grounds for suspicion.
But those were all trifles which he had not even begun to consider, andindeed he had no time. He was thinking of the chief point, and put offtrifling details, until _he could believe in it all_. But that seemedutterly unattainable. So it seemed to himself at least. He could notimagine, for instance, that he would sometime leave off thinking, getup and simply go there.... Even his late experiment (i.e. his visit withthe object of a final survey of the place) was simply an attempt atan experiment, far from being the real thing, as though one should say“come, let us go and try it--why dream about it!”--and at once hehad broken down and had run away cursing, in a frenzy with himself.Meanwhile it would seem, as regards the moral question, that hisanalysis was complete; his casuistry had become keen as a razor, and hecould not find rational objections in himself. But in the last resorthe simply ceased to believe in himself, and doggedly, slavishly soughtarguments in all directions, fumbling for them, as though someone wereforcing and drawing him to it.
At first--long before indeed--he had been much occupied with onequestion; why almost all crimes are so badly concealed and so easilydetected, and why almost all criminals leave such obvious traces? Hehad come gradually to many different and curious conclusions, and in hisopinion the chief reason lay not so much in the material impossibilityof concealing the crime, as in the criminal himself. Almost everycriminal is subject to a failure of will and reasoning power by achildish and phenomenal heedlessness, at the very instant when prudenceand caution are most essential. It was his conviction that this eclipseof reason and failure of will power attacked a man like a disease,developed gradually and reached its highest point just before theperpetration of the crime, continued with equal violence at the momentof the crime and for longer or shorter time after, according to theindividual case, and then passed off like any other disease. Thequestion whether the disease gives rise to the crime, or whether thecrime from its own peculiar nature is always accompanied by something ofthe nature of disease, he did not yet feel able to decide.
When he reached these conclusions, he decided that in his own case therecould not be such a morbid reaction, that his reason and will wouldremain unimpaired at the time of carrying out his design, for thesimple reason that his design was “not a crime....” We will omit all theprocess by means of which he arrived at this last conclusion; we haverun too far ahead already.... We may add only that the practical, purelymaterial difficulties of the affair occupied a secondary position in hismind. “One has but to keep all one’s will-power and reason to dealwith them, and they will all be overcome at the time when once one hasfamiliarised oneself with the minutest details of the business....” Butthis preparation had never been begun. His final decisions were what hecame to trust least, and when the hour struck, it all came to pass quitedifferently, as it were accidentally and unexpectedly.
One trifling circumstance upset his calculations, before he had evenleft the staircase. When he reached the landlady’s kitchen, the doorof which was open as usual, he glanced cautiously in to see whether, inNastasya’s absence, the landlady herself was there, or if not, whetherthe door to her own room was closed, so that she might not peep out whenhe went in for the axe. But what was his amazement when he suddenlysaw that Nastasya was not only at home in the kitchen, but was occupiedthere, taking linen out of a basket and hanging it on a line. Seeinghim, she left off hanging the clothes, turned to him and stared at himall the time he was passing. He turned away his eyes, and walked past asthough he noticed nothing. But it was the end of everything; he had notthe axe! He was overwhelmed.
“What made me think,” he reflected, as he went under the gateway, “whatmade me think that she would be sure not to be at home at that moment!Why, why, why did I assume this so certainly?”
He was crushed and even humiliated. He could have laughed at himself inhis anger.... A dull animal rage boiled within him.
He stood hesitating in the gateway. To go into the street, to go a walkfor appearance’ sake was revolting; to go back to his room, even morerevolting. “And what a chance I have lost for ever!” he muttered,standing aimlessly in the gateway, just opposite the porter’s littledark room, which was also open. Suddenly he started. From the porter’sroom, two paces away from him, something shining under the bench to theright caught his eye.... He looked about him--nobody. He approached theroom on tiptoe, went down two steps into it and in a faint voice calledthe porter. “Yes, not at home! Somewhere near though, in the yard, forthe door is wide open.” He dashed to the axe (it was an axe) and pulledit out from under the bench, where it lay between two chunks of wood;at once, before going out, he made it fast in the noose, he thrust bothhands into his pockets and went out of the room; no one had noticed him!“When reason fails, the devil helps!” he thought with a strange grin.This chance raised his spirits extraordinarily.
He walked along quietly and sedately, without hurry, to avoid awakeningsuspicion. He scarcely looked at the passers-by, tried to escape lookingat their faces at all, and to be as little noticeable as possible.Suddenly he thought of his hat. “Good heavens! I had the money the daybefore yesterday and did not get a cap to wear instead!” A curse rosefrom the bottom of his soul.
Glancing out of the corner of his eye into a shop, he saw by a clock onthe wall that it was ten minutes past seven. He had to make haste and atthe same time to go someway round, so as to approach the house from theother side....
When he had happened to imagine all this beforehand, he had sometimesthought that he would be very much afraid. But he was not very muchafraid now, was not afraid at all, indeed. His mind was even occupiedby irrelevant matters, but by nothing for long. As he passed the Yusupovgarden, he was deeply absorbed in considering the building of greatfountains, and of their refreshing effect on the atmosphere in allthe squares. By degrees he passed to the conviction that if the summergarden were extended to the field of Mars, and perhaps joined to thegarden of the Mihailovsky Palace, it would be a splendid thing and agreat benefit to the town. Then he was interested by the question whyin all great towns men are not simply driven by necessity, but in somepeculiar way inclined to live in those parts of the town where thereare no gardens nor fountains; where there is most dirt and smell and allsorts of nastiness. Then his own walks through the Hay Market came backto his mind, and for a moment he waked up to reality. “What nonsense!”he thought, “better think of nothing at all!”
“So probably men led to execution clutch mentally at every object thatmeets them on the way,” flashed through his mind, but simply flashed,like lightning; he made haste to dismiss this thought.... And by nowhe was near; here was the house, here was the gate. Suddenly a clocksomewhere struck once. “What! can it be half-past seven? Impossible, itmust be fast!”
Luckily for him, everything went well again at the gates. At that verymoment, as though expressly for his benefit, a huge waggon of hay hadjust driven in at the gate, completely screening him as he passed underthe gateway, and the waggon had scarcely had time to drive through intothe yard, before he had slipped in a flash to the right. On the otherside of the waggon he could hear shouting and quarrelling; but no onenoticed him and no one met him. Many windows looking into that hugequadrangular yard were open at that moment, but he did not raise hishead--he had not the strength to. The staircase leading to the oldwoman’s room was close by, just on the right of the gateway. He wasalready on the stairs....
Drawing a breath, pressing his hand against his throbbing heart, andonce more feeling for the axe and setting it straight, he began softlyand cautiously ascending the stairs, listening every minute. But thestairs, too, were quite deserted; all the doors were shut; he met noone. One flat indeed on the first floor was wide open and painters wereat work in it, but they did not glance at him. He stood still, thoughta minute and went on. “Of course it would be better if they had not beenhere, but... it’s two storeys above them.”
And there was the fourth storey, here was the door, here was theflat opposite, the empty one. The flat underneath the old woman’s wasapparently empty also; the visiting card nailed on the door had beentorn off--they had gone away!... He was out of breath. For one instantthe thought floated through his mind “Shall I go back?” But he made noanswer and began listening at the old woman’s door, a dead silence. Thenhe listened again on the staircase, listened long and intently...then looked about him for the last time, pulled himself together, drewhimself up, and once more tried the axe in the noose. “Am I very pale?”he wondered. “Am I not evidently agitated? She is mistrustful.... Had Ibetter wait a little longer... till my heart leaves off thumping?”
But his heart did not leave off. On the contrary, as though to spitehim, it throbbed more and more violently. He could stand it no longer,he slowly put out his hand to the bell and rang. Half a minute later herang again, more loudly.
No answer. To go on ringing was useless and out of place. The old womanwas, of course, at home, but she was suspicious and alone. He had someknowledge of her habits... and once more he put his ear to the door.Either his senses were peculiarly keen (which it is difficult tosuppose), or the sound was really very distinct. Anyway, he suddenlyheard something like the cautious touch of a hand on the lock and therustle of a skirt at the very door. Someone was standing stealthilyclose to the lock and just as he was doing on the outside was secretlylistening within, and seemed to have her ear to the door.... He moveda little on purpose and muttered something aloud that he might not havethe appearance of hiding, then rang a third time, but quietly, soberly,and without impatience, Recalling it afterwards, that moment stood outin his mind vividly, distinctly, for ever; he could not make out how hehad had such cunning, for his mind was as it were clouded at moments andhe was almost unconscious of his body.... An instant later he heard thelatch unfastened.

The door was as before opened a tiny crack, and again two sharp andsuspicious eyes stared at him out of the darkness. Then Raskolnikov losthis head and nearly made a great mistake.
Fearing the old woman would be frightened by their being alone, and nothoping that the sight of him would disarm her suspicions, he tookhold of the door and drew it towards him to prevent the old woman fromattempting to shut it again. Seeing this she did not pull the door back,but she did not let go the handle so that he almost dragged her out withit on to the stairs. Seeing that she was standing in the doorway notallowing him to pass, he advanced straight upon her. She stepped backin alarm, tried to say something, but seemed unable to speak and staredwith open eyes at him.
“Good evening, Alyona Ivanovna,” he began, trying to speak easily, buthis voice would not obey him, it broke and shook. “I have come... I havebrought something... but we’d better come in... to the light....”
And leaving her, he passed straight into the room uninvited. The oldwoman ran after him; her tongue was unloosed.
“Good heavens! What it is? Who is it? What do you want?”
“Why, Alyona Ivanovna, you know me... Raskolnikov... here, I brought youthe pledge I promised the other day...” And he held out the pledge.
The old woman glanced for a moment at the pledge, but at once stared inthe eyes of her uninvited visitor. She looked intently, maliciously andmistrustfully. A minute passed; he even fancied something like a sneerin her eyes, as though she had already guessed everything. He felt thathe was losing his head, that he was almost frightened, so frightenedthat if she were to look like that and not say a word for another halfminute, he thought he would have run away from her.
“Why do you look at me as though you did not know me?” he said suddenly,also with malice. “Take it if you like, if not I’ll go elsewhere, I amin a hurry.”
He had not even thought of saying this, but it was suddenly said ofitself. The old woman recovered herself, and her visitor’s resolute toneevidently restored her confidence.
“But why, my good sir, all of a minute.... What is it?” she asked,looking at the pledge.
“The silver cigarette case; I spoke of it last time, you know.”
She held out her hand.
“But how pale you are, to be sure... and your hands are trembling too?Have you been bathing, or what?”
“Fever,” he answered abruptly. “You can’t help getting pale... if you’venothing to eat,” he added, with difficulty articulating the words.
His strength was failing him again. But his answer sounded like thetruth; the old woman took the pledge.
“What is it?” she asked once more, scanning Raskolnikov intently, andweighing the pledge in her hand.
“A thing... cigarette case.... Silver.... Look at it.”
“It does not seem somehow like silver.... How he has wrapped it up!”
Trying to untie the string and turning to the window, to the light (allher windows were shut, in spite of the stifling heat), she lefthim altogether for some seconds and stood with her back to him. Heunbuttoned his coat and freed the axe from the noose, but did not yettake it out altogether, simply holding it in his right hand under thecoat. His hands were fearfully weak, he felt them every moment growingmore numb and more wooden. He was afraid he would let the axe slip andfall.... A sudden giddiness came over him.
“But what has he tied it up like this for?” the old woman cried withvexation and moved towards him.
He had not a minute more to lose. He pulled the axe quite out, swungit with both arms, scarcely conscious of himself, and almost withouteffort, almost mechanically, brought the blunt side down on her head. Heseemed not to use his own strength in this. But as soon as he had oncebrought the axe down, his strength returned to him.
The old woman was as always bareheaded. Her thin, light hair, streakedwith grey, thickly smeared with grease, was plaited in a rat’s tail andfastened by a broken horn comb which stood out on the nape of her neck.As she was so short, the blow fell on the very top of her skull. Shecried out, but very faintly, and suddenly sank all of a heap on thefloor, raising her hands to her head. In one hand she still held “thepledge.” Then he dealt her another and another blow with the blunt sideand on the same spot. The blood gushed as from an overturned glass, thebody fell back. He stepped back, let it fall, and at once bent over herface; she was dead. Her eyes seemed to be starting out of their sockets,the brow and the whole face were drawn and contorted convulsively.
He laid the axe on the ground near the dead body and felt at once in herpocket (trying to avoid the streaming body)--the same right-hand pocketfrom which she had taken the key on his last visit. He was in fullpossession of his faculties, free from confusion or giddiness, but hishands were still trembling. He remembered afterwards that he had beenparticularly collected and careful, trying all the time not to getsmeared with blood.... He pulled out the keys at once, they were all,as before, in one bunch on a steel ring. He ran at once into the bedroomwith them. It was a very small room with a whole shrine of holy images.Against the other wall stood a big bed, very clean and covered witha silk patchwork wadded quilt. Against a third wall was a chest ofdrawers. Strange to say, so soon as he began to fit the keys into thechest, so soon as he heard their jingling, a convulsive shudder passedover him. He suddenly felt tempted again to give it all up and goaway. But that was only for an instant; it was too late to go back.He positively smiled at himself, when suddenly another terrifying ideaoccurred to his mind. He suddenly fancied that the old woman might bestill alive and might recover her senses. Leaving the keys in the chest,he ran back to the body, snatched up the axe and lifted it once moreover the old woman, but did not bring it down. There was no doubt thatshe was dead. Bending down and examining her again more closely, he sawclearly that the skull was broken and even battered in on one side. Hewas about to feel it with his finger, but drew back his hand and indeedit was evident without that. Meanwhile there was a perfect pool ofblood. All at once he noticed a string on her neck; he tugged at it, butthe string was strong and did not snap and besides, it was soakedwith blood. He tried to pull it out from the front of the dress, butsomething held it and prevented its coming. In his impatience he raisedthe axe again to cut the string from above on the body, but did notdare, and with difficulty, smearing his hand and the axe in the blood,after two minutes’ hurried effort, he cut the string and took it offwithout touching the body with the axe; he was not mistaken--it was apurse. On the string were two crosses, one of Cyprus wood and one ofcopper, and an image in silver filigree, and with them a small greasychamois leather purse with a steel rim and ring. The purse was stuffedvery full; Raskolnikov thrust it in his pocket without looking at it,flung the crosses on the old woman’s body and rushed back into thebedroom, this time taking the axe with him.
He was in terrible haste, he snatched the keys, and began trying themagain. But he was unsuccessful. They would not fit in the locks. Itwas not so much that his hands were shaking, but that he kept makingmistakes; though he saw for instance that a key was not the right oneand would not fit, still he tried to put it in. Suddenly he rememberedand realised that the big key with the deep notches, which was hangingthere with the small keys could not possibly belong to the chest ofdrawers (on his last visit this had struck him), but to some strong box,and that everything perhaps was hidden in that box. He left the chestof drawers, and at once felt under the bedstead, knowing that oldwomen usually keep boxes under their beds. And so it was; there was agood-sized box under the bed, at least a yard in length, with an archedlid covered with red leather and studded with steel nails. The notchedkey fitted at once and unlocked it. At the top, under a white sheet, wasa coat of red brocade lined with hareskin; under it was a silk dress,then a shawl and it seemed as though there was nothing below butclothes. The first thing he did was to wipe his blood-stained hands onthe red brocade. “It’s red, and on red blood will be less noticeable,”the thought passed through his mind; then he suddenly came to himself.“Good God, am I going out of my senses?” he thought with terror.
But no sooner did he touch the clothes than a gold watch slipped fromunder the fur coat. He made haste to turn them all over. There turnedout to be various articles made of gold among the clothes--probablyall pledges, unredeemed or waiting to be redeemed--bracelets, chains,ear-rings, pins and such things. Some were in cases, others simplywrapped in newspaper, carefully and exactly folded, and tied round withtape. Without any delay, he began filling up the pockets of his trousersand overcoat without examining or undoing the parcels and cases; but hehad not time to take many....
He suddenly heard steps in the room where the old woman lay. He stoppedshort and was still as death. But all was quiet, so it must have beenhis fancy. All at once he heard distinctly a faint cry, as thoughsomeone had uttered a low broken moan. Then again dead silence fora minute or two. He sat squatting on his heels by the box and waitedholding his breath. Suddenly he jumped up, seized the axe and ran out ofthe bedroom.
In the middle of the room stood Lizaveta with a big bundle in her arms.She was gazing in stupefaction at her murdered sister, white as a sheetand seeming not to have the strength to cry out. Seeing him run outof the bedroom, she began faintly quivering all over, like a leaf, ashudder ran down her face; she lifted her hand, opened her mouth, butstill did not scream. She began slowly backing away from him into thecorner, staring intently, persistently at him, but still uttered nosound, as though she could not get breath to scream. He rushed at herwith the axe; her mouth twitched piteously, as one sees babies’ mouths,when they begin to be frightened, stare intently at what frightens themand are on the point of screaming. And this hapless Lizaveta was sosimple and had been so thoroughly crushed and scared that she did noteven raise a hand to guard her face, though that was the most necessaryand natural action at the moment, for the axe was raised over her face.She only put up her empty left hand, but not to her face, slowly holdingit out before her as though motioning him away. The axe fell with thesharp edge just on the skull and split at one blow all the top of thehead. She fell heavily at once. Raskolnikov completely lost his head,snatching up her bundle, dropped it again and ran into the entry.
Fear gained more and more mastery over him, especially after thissecond, quite unexpected murder. He longed to run away from the placeas fast as possible. And if at that moment he had been capable of seeingand reasoning more correctly, if he had been able to realise all thedifficulties of his position, the hopelessness, the hideousness and theabsurdity of it, if he could have understood how many obstacles and,perhaps, crimes he had still to overcome or to commit, to get out ofthat place and to make his way home, it is very possible that he wouldhave flung up everything, and would have gone to give himself up, andnot from fear, but from simple horror and loathing of what he haddone. The feeling of loathing especially surged up within him and grewstronger every minute. He would not now have gone to the box or eveninto the room for anything in the world.
But a sort of blankness, even dreaminess, had begun by degrees to takepossession of him; at moments he forgot himself, or rather, forgot whatwas of importance, and caught at trifles. Glancing, however, into thekitchen and seeing a bucket half full of water on a bench, he bethoughthim of washing his hands and the axe. His hands were sticky with blood.He dropped the axe with the blade in the water, snatched a piece of soapthat lay in a broken saucer on the window, and began washing his handsin the bucket. When they were clean, he took out the axe, washed theblade and spent a long time, about three minutes, washing the wood wherethere were spots of blood rubbing them with soap. Then he wiped it allwith some linen that was hanging to dry on a line in the kitchen andthen he was a long while attentively examining the axe at the window.There was no trace left on it, only the wood was still damp. Hecarefully hung the axe in the noose under his coat. Then as far as waspossible, in the dim light in the kitchen, he looked over his overcoat,his trousers and his boots. At the first glance there seemed to benothing but stains on the boots. He wetted the rag and rubbed the boots.But he knew he was not looking thoroughly, that there might be somethingquite noticeable that he was overlooking. He stood in the middle of theroom, lost in thought. Dark agonising ideas rose in his mind--the ideathat he was mad and that at that moment he was incapable of reasoning,of protecting himself, that he ought perhaps to be doing somethingutterly different from what he was now doing. “Good God!” he muttered “Imust fly, fly,” and he rushed into the entry. But here a shock of terrorawaited him such as he had never known before.
He stood and gazed and could not believe his eyes: the door, the outerdoor from the stairs, at which he had not long before waited and rung,was standing unfastened and at least six inches open. No lock, no bolt,all the time, all that time! The old woman had not shut it after himperhaps as a precaution. But, good God! Why, he had seen Lizavetaafterwards! And how could he, how could he have failed to reflect thatshe must have come in somehow! She could not have come through the wall!
He dashed to the door and fastened the latch.
“But no, the wrong thing again! I must get away, get away....”
He unfastened the latch, opened the door and began listening on thestaircase.
He listened a long time. Somewhere far away, it might be in the gateway,two voices were loudly and shrilly shouting, quarrelling and scolding.“What are they about?” He waited patiently. At last all was still, asthough suddenly cut off; they had separated. He was meaning to go out,but suddenly, on the floor below, a door was noisily opened and someonebegan going downstairs humming a tune. “How is it they all make sucha noise?” flashed through his mind. Once more he closed the door andwaited. At last all was still, not a soul stirring. He was just taking astep towards the stairs when he heard fresh footsteps.
The steps sounded very far off, at the very bottom of the stairs, buthe remembered quite clearly and distinctly that from the first sound hebegan for some reason to suspect that this was someone coming _there_,to the fourth floor, to the old woman. Why? Were the sounds somehowpeculiar, significant? The steps were heavy, even and unhurried. Now_he_ had passed the first floor, now he was mounting higher, it wasgrowing more and more distinct! He could hear his heavy breathing. Andnow the third storey had been reached. Coming here! And it seemed tohim all at once that he was turned to stone, that it was like a dreamin which one is being pursued, nearly caught and will be killed, and isrooted to the spot and cannot even move one’s arms.
At last when the unknown was mounting to the fourth floor, he suddenlystarted, and succeeded in slipping neatly and quickly back into theflat and closing the door behind him. Then he took the hook and softly,noiselessly, fixed it in the catch. Instinct helped him. When he haddone this, he crouched holding his breath, by the door. The unknownvisitor was by now also at the door. They were now standing opposite oneanother, as he had just before been standing with the old woman, whenthe door divided them and he was listening.
The visitor panted several times. “He must be a big, fat man,” thoughtRaskolnikov, squeezing the axe in his hand. It seemed like a dreamindeed. The visitor took hold of the bell and rang it loudly.
As soon as the tin bell tinkled, Raskolnikov seemed to be aware ofsomething moving in the room. For some seconds he listened quiteseriously. The unknown rang again, waited and suddenly tugged violentlyand impatiently at the handle of the door. Raskolnikov gazed in horrorat the hook shaking in its fastening, and in blank terror expected everyminute that the fastening would be pulled out. It certainly did seempossible, so violently was he shaking it. He was tempted to hold thefastening, but _he_ might be aware of it. A giddiness came over himagain. “I shall fall down!” flashed through his mind, but the unknownbegan to speak and he recovered himself at once.
“What’s up? Are they asleep or murdered? D-damn them!” he bawled in athick voice, “Hey, Alyona Ivanovna, old witch! Lizaveta Ivanovna, hey,my beauty! open the door! Oh, damn them! Are they asleep or what?”
And again, enraged, he tugged with all his might a dozen times atthe bell. He must certainly be a man of authority and an intimateacquaintance.
At this moment light hurried steps were heard not far off, on thestairs. Someone else was approaching. Raskolnikov had not heard them atfirst.
“You don’t say there’s no one at home,” the new-comer cried in acheerful, ringing voice, addressing the first visitor, who still went onpulling the bell. “Good evening, Koch.”
“From his voice he must be quite young,” thought Raskolnikov.
“Who the devil can tell? I’ve almost broken the lock,” answered Koch.“But how do you come to know me?”
“Why! The day before yesterday I beat you three times running atbilliards at Gambrinus’.”
“Oh!”
“So they are not at home? That’s queer. It’s awfully stupid though.Where could the old woman have gone? I’ve come on business.”
“Yes; and I have business with her, too.”
“Well, what can we do? Go back, I suppose, Aie--aie! And I was hoping toget some money!” cried the young man.
“We must give it up, of course, but what did she fix this time for? Theold witch fixed the time for me to come herself. It’s out of my way.And where the devil she can have got to, I can’t make out. She sits herefrom year’s end to year’s end, the old hag; her legs are bad and yethere all of a sudden she is out for a walk!”
“Hadn’t we better ask the porter?”
“What?”
“Where she’s gone and when she’ll be back.”
“Hm.... Damn it all!... We might ask.... But you know she never does goanywhere.”
And he once more tugged at the door-handle.
“Damn it all. There’s nothing to be done, we must go!”
“Stay!” cried the young man suddenly. “Do you see how the door shakes ifyou pull it?”
“Well?”
“That shows it’s not locked, but fastened with the hook! Do you hear howthe hook clanks?”
“Well?”
“Why, don’t you see? That proves that one of them is at home. If theywere all out, they would have locked the door from the outside with thekey and not with the hook from inside. There, do you hear how the hookis clanking? To fasten the hook on the inside they must be at home,don’t you see. So there they are sitting inside and don’t open thedoor!”
“Well! And so they must be!” cried Koch, astonished. “What are theyabout in there?” And he began furiously shaking the door.
“Stay!” cried the young man again. “Don’t pull at it! There must besomething wrong.... Here, you’ve been ringing and pulling at the doorand still they don’t open! So either they’ve both fainted or...”
“What?”
“I tell you what. Let’s go fetch the porter, let him wake them up.”
“All right.”
Both were going down.
“Stay. You stop here while I run down for the porter.”
“What for?”
“Well, you’d better.”
“All right.”
“I’m studying the law you see! It’s evident, e-vi-dent there’s somethingwrong here!” the young man cried hotly, and he ran downstairs.
Koch remained. Once more he softly touched the bell which gave onetinkle, then gently, as though reflecting and looking about him, begantouching the door-handle pulling it and letting it go to make sure oncemore that it was only fastened by the hook. Then puffing and panting hebent down and began looking at the keyhole: but the key was in the lockon the inside and so nothing could be seen.
Raskolnikov stood keeping tight hold of the axe. He was in a sort ofdelirium. He was even making ready to fight when they should come in.While they were knocking and talking together, the idea several timesoccurred to him to end it all at once and shout to them through thedoor. Now and then he was tempted to swear at them, to jeer at them,while they could not open the door! “Only make haste!” was the thoughtthat flashed through his mind.
“But what the devil is he about?...” Time was passing, one minute, andanother--no one came. Koch began to be restless.
“What the devil?” he cried suddenly and in impatience deserting hissentry duty, he, too, went down, hurrying and thumping with his heavyboots on the stairs. The steps died away.
“Good heavens! What am I to do?”
Raskolnikov unfastened the hook, opened the door--there was no sound.Abruptly, without any thought at all, he went out, closing the door asthoroughly as he could, and went downstairs.
He had gone down three flights when he suddenly heard a loud voicebelow--where could he go! There was nowhere to hide. He was just goingback to the flat.
“Hey there! Catch the brute!”
Somebody dashed out of a flat below, shouting, and rather fell than randown the stairs, bawling at the top of his voice.
“Mitka! Mitka! Mitka! Mitka! Mitka! Blast him!”
The shout ended in a shriek; the last sounds came from the yard; all wasstill. But at the same instant several men talking loud and fast begannoisily mounting the stairs. There were three or four of them. Hedistinguished the ringing voice of the young man. “Hey!”
Filled with despair he went straight to meet them, feeling “come whatmust!” If they stopped him--all was lost; if they let him pass--all waslost too; they would remember him. They were approaching; they were onlya flight from him--and suddenly deliverance! A few steps from him on theright, there was an empty flat with the door wide open, the flat on thesecond floor where the painters had been at work, and which, as thoughfor his benefit, they had just left. It was they, no doubt, who had justrun down, shouting. The floor had only just been painted, in the middleof the room stood a pail and a broken pot with paint and brushes. In oneinstant he had whisked in at the open door and hidden behind the walland only in the nick of time; they had already reached the landing.Then they turned and went on up to the fourth floor, talking loudly. Hewaited, went out on tiptoe and ran down the stairs.
No one was on the stairs, nor in the gateway. He passed quickly throughthe gateway and turned to the left in the street.
He knew, he knew perfectly well that at that moment they were at theflat, that they were greatly astonished at finding it unlocked, asthe door had just been fastened, that by now they were looking at thebodies, that before another minute had passed they would guess andcompletely realise that the murderer had just been there, and hadsucceeded in hiding somewhere, slipping by them and escaping. They wouldguess most likely that he had been in the empty flat, while they weregoing upstairs. And meanwhile he dared not quicken his pace much, thoughthe next turning was still nearly a hundred yards away. “Should heslip through some gateway and wait somewhere in an unknown street? No,hopeless! Should he fling away the axe? Should he take a cab? Hopeless,hopeless!”
At last he reached the turning. He turned down it more dead than alive.Here he was half way to safety, and he understood it; it was less riskybecause there was a great crowd of people, and he was lost in it like agrain of sand. But all he had suffered had so weakened him that he couldscarcely move. Perspiration ran down him in drops, his neck was all wet.“My word, he has been going it!” someone shouted at him when he came outon the canal bank.
He was only dimly conscious of himself now, and the farther he went theworse it was. He remembered however, that on coming out on to the canalbank, he was alarmed at finding few people there and so being moreconspicuous, and he had thought of turning back. Though he was almostfalling from fatigue, he went a long way round so as to get home fromquite a different direction.
He was not fully conscious when he passed through the gateway of hishouse! He was already on the staircase before he recollected the axe.And yet he had a very grave problem before him, to put it back and toescape observation as far as possible in doing so. He was of courseincapable of reflecting that it might perhaps be far better not torestore the axe at all, but to drop it later on in somebody’s yard. Butit all happened fortunately, the door of the porter’s room was closedbut not locked, so that it seemed most likely that the porter was athome. But he had so completely lost all power of reflection that hewalked straight to the door and opened it. If the porter had asked him,“What do you want?” he would perhaps have simply handed him the axe. Butagain the porter was not at home, and he succeeded in putting the axeback under the bench, and even covering it with the chunk of wood asbefore. He met no one, not a soul, afterwards on the way to his room;the landlady’s door was shut. When he was in his room, he flung himselfon the sofa just as he was--he did not sleep, but sank into blankforgetfulness. If anyone had come into his room then, he would havejumped up at once and screamed. Scraps and shreds of thoughts weresimply swarming in his brain, but he could not catch at one, he couldnot rest on one, in spite of all his efforts....
